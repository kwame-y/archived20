## link blogs

- [link roundups, in dark trees](https://indarktrees.com/roundups/)
- [responses, maya.land](https://maya.land/responses/)
- [what else is on?](https://whatelseison.net/)
- [[leaf litter]] (i made this)

## meta-directories

- [Brisray's Webring List](https://brisray.com/web/webring-list.htm)
	- more than a list, really. a comprehensive, regularly-maintained, sortable database of webrings
- [BUKMARK.CLUB](https://bukmark.club/)
	- directory of sites with bookmarks/links/blogroll pages
	- i wish the directory sent you straight to each site's links page. sometimes they're really tucked away...

## random redirect portals 

- moonjump.app
	- the [homepage](https://moonjump.app/) is currently unpleasant to use. i don't like the URL being hidden
	- instead, i prefer to [jump directly to an are.na link](https://moonjump.app/arena)
		- update: this doesn't work anymore. devastating
- wiby's [surprise me!](https://wiby.me/surprise/) button
- [the forest](https://theforest.link/) - pretty dev heavy (boring portfolio style) but there are a few rare gems 
- [[spore dispersal]] (i made this)

## [[www/social/index|social networks]]

- forums
	- 32-Bit Cafe's [Links Around the Web](https://discourse.32bit.cafe/c/links/45) category
	- Melonland's [Hyperlinks](https://forum.melonland.net/index.php?board=37.0) board
- are.na channels
	- [Chia's poetic web](https://www.are.na/chia/poetic-web)
- bluesky feeds
	- [World Wide Web](https://bsky.app/profile/ribo.zone/feed/aaai2qt6lgrng) (i made this with [skyfeed](https://skyfeed.app/))
	- [Trending Links](https://bsky.app/profile/why.bsky.team/feed/links) (sometimes interesting, but rarely ever fun)
