[leaf litter](https://litter.leaflet.pub/) is my weekly (?) linkblog hosted on [[atproto#leaflet.pub|leaflet.pub]]

> I'm calling it leaf litter because I like a metaphor that says it's all fine and good to leave a big mess on the ground. my plan is to collect interesting links throughout the week, then hit publish without fussing too much with organization and annotation. just a big pile of links for you (and future me) to make into shelter or nutrients or some other thing not covered by this silly metaphor.

i like leaflet because the link previews look nice and it's super easy to update from my phone. however, a reverse chronological list of posts is one of my least favorite ways to store info long term, so i'd like to organize the links i share into topic-based pages on my own sites[^1]. *this page* is where i'm keeping track of my progress towards that goal.

🍄 = included in the [[spore dispersal]] site list
📓 = linked somewhere on this site
🏠 = linked on my main site

- [ ] #005: articles about tech
- [x] #004 : sound toys 📓🏠
- [x] #003 : web tools and libraries 📓🏠
- [x] #002 : geometry 📓 ; the net 📓 ; frogs 🍄🏠 ; cnidarians 📓 ; iNat 🍄📓🏠
- [x] #001 : bird logs 📓

[^1]: also it's good to have backups in case something happens to bluesky or leaflet
