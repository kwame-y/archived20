## how does it work

PDS, lexicon, appview, relay, etc ???

## bluesky
the main microblogging atproto thing
- made more tolerable by [tokimeki](https://tokimeki.blue/)
	- easy to switch between single and multi column view (yay)
	- can turn off repost and like counters (yay)
	- can turn off reposts for specific users (yay)
- recommended feed: [quiet posters](https://bsky.app/profile/why.bsky.team/feed/infreq)
## other platforms
### [leaflet.pub](https://leaflet.pub) 
document creation tool w/ publications on atproto
- [[leaf litter]], my linkblog, is hosted here

### [teal.fm](https://teal.fm) 
[[music/index|music]] scrobbling
- i probably won't sign up because i'm not into scrobbling so much anymore, and even if i was, the ways i listen to music on my computer [are the devs' lowest priority](https://notes.teal.fm/3lzlwe6puis2l/l-quote/22.2_0-22.2_64#22.2_0)
- however! i will be keeping an eye on this to see what people are listening to
