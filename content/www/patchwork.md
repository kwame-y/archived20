> [!abstract] Lowtech Manifesto, [lowtech.org](http://lowtech.org/projects/n5m3/)
> Independence is important. Don't lock your creativity into a box you don't control.
> Access is important. Don't lock your creativity into a format we can't see.

> [!example] Design tenets of my website, [tombubil.info](https://tombubul.info/tenets.html)
> As with items in my flatfile or on my desk, organization shall not be an abiding concern, though resulting confusion shall never be an intentional effect. Data organization shall follow the terms of “I think I know where it is” and “it’s in there somewhere,” as elsewhere in my life.
>  - - -
> All page content is subject to change, but no page's styles or structure need ever be updated. Old pages retaining old markup should be considered kin to old subway stations retaining old signage with old typefaces. Pages shall be permitted to deteriorate.
 >  - - -
> The website does not need to be an archive, but obscuring or disclaiming stuff shall be considered more desirable than removing it outright. It should seek to embrace the truth of mistakes and failures without necessary obligation to archive or present the material results of those processes.

> [!question] Melon’s Manifesto v1.1, [melonking.net](https://melonking.net/thoughts/manifesto)
> Use your tools to make things, don't make things about your tools. Technology and the end result are in a dance, one can never lead the other too long.
>  - - -
> All the best things start as jokes and anything worth saying is worth taking a long time to say.

> [!note] A Handmade Web, [luckysoap.com](https://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html)
> I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.
>  - - -
> I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention both to the manual labour involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a 'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions required for a computer program to run.
>  - - -
> I evoke the term 'handmade web' to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of resistance.

> [!tip] principles, [permacomputing.net](https://permacomputing.net/principles/)
> There is a place for almost everything. Nothing is obsolete or irrelevant. Even if they lose their original meaning and context, most programmable systems may be readapted to new purposes for which they were not originally designed. Think about technology as a rhizome rather than a "highway of progress and constant obsolescence".

> [!question] My Website Is My Toy, [mycorrhiza.space](https://mycorrhiza.space/Blog/2025-03-22-mye_touy)
> I think an important step in mastery is getting silly with it. This is also where I'm no longer just acting upon my site but my site is also influencing me.
>  - - -
> By seeing my website as a toy I also approach it with more curiosity. What new thing can I build? What new type of code can I try here? How would this update look?

> [!bug] The Organic Web, [decay.connie.surf](https://decay.connie.surf/)
> Sometimes I think the internet is purposely built for remembering too much as a revenue driver - as we hold more data, we pay more. But we need to let go to allow for transformation of our ideas, and ourselves.

> [!success] HTML Day and celebrating websites, [kayserifserif.place](https://kayserifserif.place/posts/2025/html-day)
> The idea of “[HTML Energy](https://html.energy/)”, to me, is about celebrating the web and celebrating websites — handmade websites, indie websites, websites made with raw materials; painfully, delightfully personal and human websites. Websites, not as anonymous sources of data for machines to slurp up, but as creative expression, as digital homes, as graffiti alleys, as studio spaces, as portals, as safe havens.
