# [[Biomolecule|Organic Molecule]] [[Synthesis]] 
- [[Biomolecule|Biomolecules]] are [[Polymer|polymers]] (chains) of subunits called [[Monomer|monomers]]
- [[Polymer|Polymers]] are broken apart through [[hydrolysis]] (“water cutting”)
	- [[Dihydrogen Oxide|Water]] is broken into H and OH and used to break the bond between [[Monomer|monomers]] ![[Hydrolysis.png]]
- [[Monomer|Monomers]] are joined together through ==Dehydration [[Synthesis|Synthesis]] Reactions== ![[Dehydration Synthesis.png]]
