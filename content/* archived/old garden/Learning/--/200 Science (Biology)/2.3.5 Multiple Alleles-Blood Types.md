# Codominance in Human Blood
- Human blood types are determined by genes that follow the _codominance_ pattern of inheritance.
- There are two **dominant** alleles A and B and one **_recessive_** allele O.
- **Possible blood types are:**
  - **Type O = OO**
  - **Type AB = AB**
  - **Type A = AA (Homozygous), AO (Heterozygous)**
  - **Type B = BB (Homozygous), BO (Heterozygous)
