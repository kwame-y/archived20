# Basic Genetics
- Biologists use letters to represent genes
- Genes are commonly referred to as **alleles**
![[Allele.jpg]]
## Dominant vs. Recessive
- Not all traits are observed equally
- **Dominant Allele** → The trait that will be observed (Represented by a capital letter)
- **Recessive Allele** → The trait that may be hidden (Represented by a lowercase letter)
## Homozygous vs. Heterozygous
- **Homozygous** → both alleles are the **same** (AA, aa)
- **Heterozygous** → both alleles are the **different** (Aa)
## Genotype vs. Phenotype
- **Genotype** -> The trait shown as alleles (letteres) - AA, Aa, aa
- **Phenotype** -> Actually observing the trait (physical expression — what we see)
