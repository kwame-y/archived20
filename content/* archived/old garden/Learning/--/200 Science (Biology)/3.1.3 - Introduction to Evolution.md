# History of Natural Selection
**==Lamarck ==** ***==(THIS GUY IS WRONG)==***
- Pre-Darwin (early 1800s)
- Believe **organisms evolved through inheritance of ==acquired characteristics==**
	- However **you modify your body during your life will be passed onto your offspring** 
		- Giraffes stretched out their necks to reach leaves on tree tops, and the stretched neck was passed on
		- A father that pumped iron will produce a body builder baby
 **Darwin & Wallace**
- In 1859, Darwin published his book “On Origin of Species”
	- This is when we really started to understand evolution
# Darwin’s 4 Postulates
1. **Individuals in a population differ from one another** (*Diversity*)
2. Some **differences are due to characteristics that are passed down from parent to child** (*Inherited Variation*)
3. **More offspring are produced than can survive**, so some will survive and reproduce and others will not
4. ==Survival and reproduction depend on advantageous traits==. Those with traits that give them an advantage will **survive and have more offspring** than those that do not have advantageous 
# Natural Selection
- Natural Selection explains the changes in **populations** over time
- Natural Selection is also know as “*survival of the fittest*” meaning that the most fit organism in the environment will survive
