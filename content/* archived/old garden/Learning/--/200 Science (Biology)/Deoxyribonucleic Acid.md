**[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] ([[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]]) is a [[Polymer]] composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix**. **The [[Polymer|polymer]] carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many [[Virus|viruses]]**. DNA and [[Ribonucleic Acid]] ([[Ribonucleic Acid|RNA]]) are [[Nucleic Acids]]. Alongside [[Proteins]], [[Lipids]], and complex [[Carbohydrates]] ([[Polysaccharide|polysaccharides]]), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of [[Macromolecule|macromolecules]] that are essential for all known forms of life. **The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides[^1] as they are composed of simpler [[Monomer|monomeric units]] called nucleotides[^2]. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four [[Nitrogen]]-containing nucleobases (cytosine, guanine, adenine, or thymine)**, ==a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group==. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phosphodiester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. *The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA.* **The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, the single-ringed pyrimidines and the double-ringed purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine.**
