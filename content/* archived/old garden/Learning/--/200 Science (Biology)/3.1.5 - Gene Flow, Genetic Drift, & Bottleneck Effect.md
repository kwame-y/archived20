# [[Gene Flow]]
- The random movement of individuals between populations *(of the same species)* increases genetic variation within the populations. 
- A population in **genetic equilibrium experiences** no [[gene flow]], with no new genes entering or leaving the population ***(rare)***
# [[Genetic Drift]]
- **Random change** in the allelic frequencies in a population that results from **chance**.
- Happens to all populations, but has a more drastic effect on **smaller** populations
- 2 Types: 
	- ==[[Founder Effect]]
		- The **loss** of **genetic variation** that occurs when a small group from a larger population, of individuals establishes a **new** population
	- ==[[Bottleneck Effect]]
		- When a population's size is reduced drastically. Can be caused by natural disaster
			- ex: fire, hurricane, etc.
