# [[Nucleic Acids]]
- [[Nucleic Acids|Nucleic Acids]] are made of the [[Monomer|monomer]] **Nucleotides**. They are made up of **[[Carbon]], [[Hydrogen]], [[Oxygen]], [[Nitrogen]], and [[Phosphorus]]**.  
## [[Monomer|Monomers]] 
- ==Nucleotides have 3 parts==
	1. ==Sugar (deoxyribose for **[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]**, ribose for **[[Ribonucleic Acid]]**)==
	2. ==Phosphate==
	3. ==Nitrogenous bases==
		- **[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]** → Adenine, ***Thymine***, Cytosine, Guanine
		- **[[Ribonucleic Acid]]** → Adenine, ***Uracil***, Cytosine, Guanine
- Each **nucleotide** consists of 3 parts:
	- *nitrogen base* (C-N ring)
	- *pentose suga*r (5C)
		- **ribose** in [[Ribonucleic Acid]]
		- **deoxyribose** in [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] 
	- *phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) group*

## [[Polymer|Polymer]]
- *Nucleic Acid [[Polymer]]* — **When many nucleotides bond together to create a chain of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] or [[Ribonucleic Acid]]**
- The [[Polymer]] is ==[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] ([[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|deoxyribonucleic acid]]) which a double stranded== and ==[[Ribonucleic Acid|Ribonucleic Acid]] ([[Ribonucleic Acid|ribonucleic acid]]) is single stranded.==
- Two **polynucleotide**[^1] strands wrap around each other to form a [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] **double helix**.
	- **Complementary Base Pairing** —
		- **Adenine always bonds with Thymine**
		- **Cytosine always bonds with Guanine** 
	- A—T, C—G, producing **base pairs**
# Form follows Function
- Basic instructions for living things (**blueprints for [[Cell|cells]]**)
- Make up components of genetic information **([[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]/[[Ribonucleic Acid]]) in all living things**
- ==The fact that all living things have [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] is always tested. The sequence (order) of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] can be different but **ALL** living things HAVE [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] in their [[Cell|cells]].==
- ==The order of the nitrogen bases determines the genetic makeup of the individual==
- [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] is **double stranded** and is coiled up into the shape of a [[Chromosome]] that is linear (**looks like an X**) in [[Eukaryotic|eukaryotic cells]]. It is packaged in a [[Nucleus|nucleus]], humans have 46 [[Chromosome|chromosomes]] in each [[Cell]].
	- [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] sequence is copied into [[Ribonucleic Acid|Ribonucleic Acid]] this is called transcription
	- [[Ribonucleic Acid|Ribonucleic Acid]] sequence is translated into amino acids sequence ([[1.2.6 - Proteins|proteins]])
	- Amino acid sequence determines the [[1.2.6 - Proteins|protein]] shape and function

# [[Adenosine Triphosphate]]
- *[[Adenosine Triphosphate]]*
	- *Adenine* nucleotide
	- **Three total phosphate groups**
- High energy bond between phosphates are broken
	- Releasing energy for the [[Cell]]
		- [[Adenosine Triphosphate]] → [[Adenosine Diphosphate|ADP]] ([[Adenosine Diphosphate]])
