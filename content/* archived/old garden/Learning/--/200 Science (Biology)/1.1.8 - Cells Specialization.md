# [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]
[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]], short for **==[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]==**, holds all the ==genetic information== that determines an organisms ==traits==. Within the ==structure== of **DNA is the information for ==life==**—the complete instructions for manufacturing all the ==[[Proteins]]== for an organism.
## Structure
- [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] in [[1.1.5 - Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes#Eukaryotes|eukaryotic cells]] is typically ==linear== and shaped like a ==twisted ladder== celled a double helix.
- **The [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] of all known organisms consists of the same basic components called *nucleotides***
- **The sequence of the nucleotides determines everything** from the type of organism to the types of cells composing the organism.
# Cell Specialization
Although nearly every [[Cell]] in a multicellular organism contains all of the [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] of that organism, not all of the genes are expressed in each cell. **Only the genes specific to each type of [[Cell]] are expressed** causing the cells to become specialized. This allows the organism to maintain homeostasis due to every cell performing its specific function.
- Ex.
	- **Erythrocytes**: red blood cells that carry [[Oxygen]] throughout the body
	- **Cheek Cells**: squamous cells protect the inside of the mouth
	- **Sperm Cells**: male gametes (sex cells) that are used to produce offspring 
	- **Memory Cells**: immune cells that “store” the information of previously encountered pathogens
