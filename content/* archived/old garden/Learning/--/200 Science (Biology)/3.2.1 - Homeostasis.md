# [[Homeostasis]]
>[[Homeostasis]] is the regulation and maintenance of the internal environment
- ==Conditions within the body must stay within a narrow range==
	- [[Homeostasis|Homeostasis]] involves keeping the **internal environment** *within set ranges*
**Control systems** help maintain [[homeostasis]]
- **Sensors**: Gather data
	- [[senses]]
- **Control Center**: receives data, interprets info, sends messages out
	- [[Brain]]
- **Communication System**: delivers messages to target [[organs]], tissues
	- PNS (e.g. motor [[Neuron|neurons]])
- **Targets**: respond to change
	- [[Muscles]], [[glands]] (release [[hormones]])
---
- A disruption of [[homeostasis|homeostasis]] can be harmful
- ==Homeostasis can be disrupted for several reasons==
	- Sensors fail (don't detect changes)
	- Targets do not receive messages ([[nerve]] issues)
	- Injury (overwhelm homeostatic controls)
	- Illness ([[Virus|Viruses]] or [[Bacteria]])
>Disruption of [[homeostasis|homeostasis]] can begin in one organ and cause a chain reaction in the others therefore causing a major body disturbance.
## Feedback Loops
> Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. The system can then be said to feed back into itself.
### Negative Feedback Loops
- Negative feedback loops are necessary for [[homeostasis|homeostasis]]
- Feedback compares **current conditions** to the body’s **comfort levels**
- ***Negative feedback*** counteracts change and brings the body back to [[homeostasis|homeostasis]]
#### Example
1. Holding breath, CO2 levels rise[[#^c456ad]] ^3f1e1e
2. Control system forces exhale, inhale[[#^8657be]]^c456ad
3. O2/CO2 level returns to normal[[#^3f1e1e]]^8657be
### Positive Feedback Loops
- Positive feedback increases change away from the set points, which is need for rapid change in the bloody
#### Examples
1. Torn blood vessels stimulate the release of clotting factors to stop blood flow
2. Growth hormones stimulate cell division
3. Labour for pregnant women
	- This causes the release of [[oxytocin]] for contractions 
## Thermoregulation
>The process of maintaining a steady body temperature under a variety of conditions
>Systems involved:
>- [[Muscular System|Muscular]]
>- [[Integumentary System|Integumentary]]
>- [[Respiratory System|Respiratory]]
>- [[Circulatory System|Circulatory]]
>- [[Nervous System|Nervous]]
>- [[Endocrine System|Endocrine]]
