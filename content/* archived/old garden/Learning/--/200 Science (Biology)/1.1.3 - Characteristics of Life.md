	- Bio — life
	- ology — study

# Characteristics of Life
- All organisms share basic properties
	- [[1.1.3 - Characteristics of Life#Composed of Cells|Composed of cells]]
	- [[1.1.3 - Characteristics of Life#Reproduce|Reproduce]]
	- Metabolism/Requires energy
	- Maintain homeostasis
	- Show heredity and contain genetic material
	- Respond to [[stimuli]]
	- Growth and Development
	- Evolve and Adapt
## Composed of [[Cell|Cells]]
To be living you must be **made of at least one or more [[Cell|cells]]**. **[[Cell|Cells]] are the smallest structural unit of an organism that is capable of independent functioning.**
- Bacteria are living because they’re “unicellular” which means they are made of one [[Cell]].
- Fungi, plants and Animals are all living because they’re “multicellular” which means they’re made of multiple [[Cell|cells]].
- Protists are living because they’re made of at least one [[Cell]].
- ***[[Virus|VIRUSES]] ARE NON-LIVING*** because they are not made of at least one or more [[Cell|cells]].
## Reproduce
To be living, you must **be able to reproduce.**
- [[Sexual Reproduction]]
	- [[Sperm]] & [[Egg]]
- [[Asexual Reproduction]]
	- [[Binary Fission]]![[Binary-Fission.jpg]]
	- Budding ![[Hydra_Budding.svg]]
	- Fragmentation ![[Fragmentation.png]]
- ***[[Virus|VIRUSES]] ARE NON-LIVING*** because they **cannot reproduce on their own**. They **need a [[Host|host cell]] in order to reproduce.**
## [[Metabolism]]
To be living you must be able to metabolize, which means you **obtain and use energy.**
