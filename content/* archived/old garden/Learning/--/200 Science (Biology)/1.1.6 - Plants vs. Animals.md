# plants and Animals
 Both plant cells and animal cells are complex and have a lot in common, they also have some important differences! Though all [[Cell|cells]] have a [[Cytoplasmic Membrane|Cell Membrane]], **plant cells have a [[Cell Wall]]**. This gives them support and structure.
## [[Mitochondria]]
Both plant and animal cells have **mitochondria**. These organelles help cells process energy (by *cellular respiration*) and provide it to the [[Cell]] in a usable form (**[[Adenosine Triphosphate]]**).

As you learned, the **[[Endosymbiotic theory]]**[^1] states that some organelles in [[Eukaryotes|eukaryotes]] were once prokaryotic microbes that were consumed and became [[1.1.5 - Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes#Endosymbiotic Theory|symbiotic]] with the larger [[Cell]].

Similar to [[Prokaryotes|prokaryotes]], mitochondria:
- divide by binary fission (reproduce)
- contain a double membrane
- take in material from outside the [[Cell]]

>The mitochondria cannot live on its own outside the [[Cell]]

## [[Chloroplasts]]
Chloroplasts are **found in plant cells and algae (and cyanobacteria)**,  NOT animal cells.

Chloroplasts are responsible for carrying out **photosynthesis**, the important process that converts radiant energy *(sunlight)*, into chemical energy *(sugar)*. That sugar is chained together and stored in plants as **starch.** 

Similar to [[1.1.4 -  Viruses vs. Prokaryotes#Prokaryotes|prokaryotes]] (and mitochondria), **chloroplasts**:
1. divide by binary fission
2. contain a double membrane
3. take in material from outside the [[Cell]]

>Chloroplasts cannot live on their own outside the [[Cell]]

>[!tip]-
>Because ==muscles cells== help us move **they require a lot of energy**. That energy must be processed, which of course happens in the mitochondria!

Cardiac cells, a type of muscle [[Cell]], are constantly working, which is why they have many, many mitochondria.
>
Other cells don’t require as much energy to carry out their jobs. In fact, blood cells don’t contain mitochondria at all. Their job is to transport material throughout the organism and an organ system.
