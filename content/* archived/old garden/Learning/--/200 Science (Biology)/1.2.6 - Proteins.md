# Structure
- [[Proteins]] are made up of **[[Carbon]], [[Hydrogen]], [[Oxygen]], [[Nitrogen]],** and sometimes **[[Sulfur]]**
## [[Monomer|Monomer]]
- [[Proteins|Protein]] **building blocks** are also known as **[[Amino Acids|amino acids]]**. There are **twenty different types** of amino acids.
	- ==Amino Acid = [[Monomer]]==

## [[Polymer|Polymer]]
- [[Proteins|Protein]] [[Polymer|Polymer]] — When many amino acids bond together to create long chains
- The [[Polymer|polymer]] is called a [[Proteins|protein]] and it is also called a **[[Proteins|polypeptide]],** because it has several **peptide bonds**
![[polypeptide.png]]
- Ex.
	- **Lactase**
		- An [[Enzyme]] that breaks down the sugar (*lactose*) in milk. *If it ends in **ASE** it is an [[Enzyme]]*
	- **Hemoglobin**
		- A [[Proteins|protein]] that carries [[Oxygen]] in blood
	- **Actin and Myosin**
		- [[Proteins]] that aid in muscle contraction
- ==All enzymes are [[Proteins]] but not all [[Proteins]] are enzymes==
## Form follows function 
- The order of the amino acids determines the function/type of [[Proteins|protein]] 
# Functions
1. **Build tissue and muscle**
2. *Speed up chemical reactions* (**enzymes**)
3. Aid in **hormone production**
4. **Transport** molecules in and out of the [[Cell]]
