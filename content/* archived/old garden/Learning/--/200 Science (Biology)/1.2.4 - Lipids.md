# [[Lipids|Lipids]] 
[[Lipids|Lipid]] building blocks ([[Monomer|monomers]]) are also known as **glycerol and fatty acids**. *They do not have a true [[Monomer|monomer]]* but the STAAR will want glycerol and fatty acids TYPICALLY. 
>[!tip]- Glycerol
![[Glycerin_Skelett.svg.png]]
- **Triglyceride** - “three glycerides” ^e10dbb
	- Triglycerides do not bond together, therefore [[Lipids|lipids]] do not have a true [[Polymer|polymer]] form.
# Functions
1. *Provide long term energy storage* 
2. *Provide insulation*
3. *Making biological membranes*
4. *Protection/Water Resistance*
5. *Acting as hormones*
# Form follows Function
- **Saturated Fatty Acid**
	- ==No double bond==, fats found **solid** at room temperature.
		- Ex. ==butter, fatty meat, waxes==
- **Unsaturated Fatty Acid**
	- ==One double bond==, fats found **liquid** at room temperature
		- Ex. ==olive oil, vegetable oil==

- **Phospholipids**
	- A phosphate group attached to fatty acid chains. Build and repair cellular membranes
		- Ex. ==phospholipid bilayer==

- **Steroids**: 
	- Have 4 carbon rings attached to a fatty acid chain. Steroids perform various functions in the cells and body
		- Ex. ==hormones, cholesterol==
