# [[Biomolecule|Organic Compounds]]
There are four types of [[Biomolecule|Organic Compounds]] that form the cells of living things
1. [[1.2.2 - Carbohydrates#Carbohydrates|Carbohydrates]] 
	1. (simplest = sugars)
2. [[1.2.4 - Lipids#Lipids Lipids|Lipid]]
3. [[1.2.6 - Proteins|Proteins]]
4. [[1.2.5 - Nucleic Acids#Nucleic Acids|Nucleic Acids]]
- Molecules are typically classified as [[Biomolecule|biomolecules]] ([[Biomolecule|Organic Molecule]] ) if they contain various combinations of the following elements:
	- [[Carbon]] - C
	- [[Hydrogen]] - H
	- [[Oxygen]] - O
	- [[Nitrogen]] - N
	- [[Phosphorus]] - P
	- [[Sulfur]] - S
# [[Carbohydrates]]
- Made of **simple sugars**
- Made up of different combinations of **[[Carbon]], [[Hydrogen]], and [[Oxygen]]** 
- **Quick energy** source for plants and animals
- **Structural component** of plants and animals
- **Biological recognition device**
The building blocks of [[Carbohydrates]] are also known as **saccharides**, which is another word for **sugar**. There are three types of sugars:
- **[[Monosaccharide]]** — “**one sugar**” ^8733b7
	- These are [[Carbohydrates|carbohydrate]] [[Monomer|monomers]] are commonly called “**simple sugars**.” Examples are glucose or fructose 
- **[[Disaccharide]]** — “**two sugars**”
	- Composed of two [[Monosaccharide|monosaccharides]] combine, such as sucrose and lactose 
- **[[Polysaccharide]]** — “**many sugars**”
	- These are long chains of **[[Monosaccharide|monosaccharides]] connected together** (*[[Polysaccharide]]/[[Polymer]]*) that form substances such as **starches and glycogen** 
		- Glycogen
			- ==Animal Food Storage==
		- Starch
			- ==Plant Food Storage==
# Form follows Function
- ***Starch has a different structure than glycogen because they serve different functions.***
- Starches are **forms of energy** (*food*) **storage in plants**, so the molecules form lines that can them be wound into tight coils, providing fast energy access.
