# History of Cells
- *Robert Hooke* used the first microscope to look at a thin slice of cork in 1665. He saw “a lot of little boxes,” which reminded him of small rooms that monks lived in called *CELLS*!
- 10 years later, *Anton van Leeuwenhoek* viewed pond [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]] under a microscope and discovered many tiny, living creatures which he called “animalcules.”
- Today, we know that they were not animals, but ***single-celled organisms***.
## The [[Cell]] Theory
1.  **All living things are ==made of one or more [[Cell|cells]]==.**
2.  **Cells are the ==basic unit== of structure and function in living things.**
3. **All [[Cell|cells]] ==arise from existing [[Cell|cells]]==.**
# [[Prokaryotes]]
**[[Prokaryotes]]** are living, single-celled organisms that don’t have membrane-bound organelles. 
- They are **very simple and small and due to lack of complex organelles,** can’t carry out many specialised functions, they lack a nucleus
- They can **grow and divide very rapidly** through binary fission. 
	- For example, E. coli bacteria, that live inside your gut, can produce a new generation every 17 minutes.
- They can live in a range of environments. Some don’t even need [[Oxygen]] to survive, some make their own food, some live in extremely hot or extremely cold environments (extremophiles)
- Prokaryotes are **SIMPLE**.
	- Bacteria
- Prokaryotes have NO organelles.
	- PRO rhymes with NO….NO NUCLEUS!
- Prokaryotes have ***[[Cell Wall|CELL WALLS]]*** and [[Cytoplasmic Membrane|Cell Membrane]].
	- **ALL [[Cell|cells]] have a [[Cytoplasmic Membrane|Cell Membrane]]**
