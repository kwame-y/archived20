# [[Virus|Viruses]]
A [[Virus|virus]] is a **non-cellular particle made up of genetic material & protein that can invade living [[Cell|cells]].**
1. [[Virus|Viruses]] are not [[Cell|cells]]
2. [[Virus|Viruses]] cannot reproduce by themselves
	- They ***must*** have a [[Host]]
3. [[Virus|Viruses]] do not use energy
4. [[Virus|Viruses]] do not respond to the environment
5. [[Virus|Viruses]] do not respire, metabolize or grow
## Types of [[Virus|Viruses]]
### [[Bacteriophage]]
- [[Virus|Viruses]] that attack ==bacteria== are called ==[[Bacteriophage|bacteriophages]]==
### [[Retrovirus]]
- HIV, the AIDS, is a [[Retrovirus]]
- Starts with [[Ribonucleic Acid]] → makes [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] → then moves forward
## Characteristics/Structure
- [[Virus|Viruses]] have a protective coat called the [[Capsid|capsid]]
- Have a core containing genetic material ([[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]/[[Ribonucleic Acid]])
- Some [[Virus|viruses]] have [[Glycoproteins|projections]] to help attach to the [[Host]] [[Cell]]
	- aka. [[Glycoproteins]]
- Most [[Virus|viruses]] infect only ***==specific==*** [[Host]] cells
	- The flu (influenza) attaches to lung tissue
	- HIV only affects immune cells specifically T-cells
- They may also have a viral envelope made up of [[1.2.4 - Lipids#^868bba|phospholipids]].
- [[Virus|Viruses]] lack many things [[Cell|cells]] have
	- No [[Nucleus|nucleus]]
	- No organelles
	- No [[Cytoplasmic Membrane|cell membrane]]
## Size/Shape of [[Virus|Viruses]]

## Treating/Preventing [[Virus|Viruses]]
Most of the time, treating people with a [[Virus]] involves treating symptoms, like cold symptoms can be treated with cold medicine. [[Antiviral|Antivirals]], on the other hand, work directly on the [[Virus]]

>[!faq]- Why do you have to get a flu shot every year?
>Your body creates memory cells to remember how to fight a disease.

>However, some [[Virus|viruses]] mutate and change. The body does not recognize this mutated [[Virus]].
