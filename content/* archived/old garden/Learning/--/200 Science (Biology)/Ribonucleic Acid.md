[[Ribonucleic Acid]] ([[Ribonucleic Acid|RNA]]) is a [[Polymer|polymeric]] molecule that is **essential for most biological functions, either by performing the function itself (non-coding RNA) or by forming a template for the production of [[Proteins]] ([[Ribonucleic Acid#Ribosomal RNA|messenger RNA]]**). RNA and [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] ([[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]]) are [[Nucleic Acids]]. The [[Nucleic Acids]] constitute one of the four major [[Macromolecule|macromolecule]][^1] essential for all known forms of life. RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides. ==Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the nitrogenous bases of guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine, denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific [[Proteins]].== Many [[Virus|viruses]] encode their genetic information using an RNA genome. **Some RNA molecules play an active role within [[Cell|cells]] by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals.** **One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function in which [[Ribonucleic Acid|RNA]] molecules direct the synthesis of [[Proteins]] on [[Ribosomes]]. This process uses [[Ribonucleic Acid#Transfer RNA|transfer RNA]] ([[Ribonucleic Acid#Transfer RNA|tRNA]]) molecules to deliver [[Amino Acids|amino acids]] to the ribosome, where [[Ribonucleic Acid#Ribosomal RNA|ribosomal RNA]] ([[Ribonucleic Acid#Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]]) then links amino acids together to form coded [[Proteins]].**
