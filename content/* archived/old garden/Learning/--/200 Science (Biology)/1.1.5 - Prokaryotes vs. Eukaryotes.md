# Prokaryote Structure
- **Genetic material ([[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]])** is a single circular molecule. This loop is located near the center of the [[Cell]], called the ==nucleoid==.
- add link to the prokaryote rhymes heading here
# Eukaryotes
- The first [[Cell|cells]] with **internal compartments.**
	- Evolved about 2.5 billion years ago.
	- Eukaryotes include **plants and animals** and **have a nucleus and other membrane bound organelles.**
- Includes **plants and Animals**
- **EU rhymes with Do**….Eukaryotes ==DO HAVE A NUCLEUS!==
## Eukaryotic Organelles
- [[Nucleus]]
- [[Mitochondria|Mitochondria]]
- [[Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum]]
- [[Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum]]
- [[Golgi Apparatus]] 
- [[Vesicles]]
- [[Ribosomes]]
- [[Vacuoles]]
- [[Lysosomes]] (Specific to Animals)
- [[Chloroplasts]] (Specific to plants)
- [[Peroxisomes]]
- [[Centrioles]]
- [[Cytoplasmic Membrane|Cell Membrane]] 
- [[Cell Wall]] (Specific to plants)
- Centrosomes (Specific to Animals)
# Endosymbiotic Theory
- **ENDO**- *Within, inner, absorbing or containing.*
- **SYMBIOTIC**- *Interaction between 2 different organisms.*
- States some organelles in eukaryotic cells were once prokaryotic organisms. (Specifically the [[1.1.6 - Plants vs. Animals#Mitochondria|Mitochondria]] and [[Chloroplasts|Chloroplasts]])
