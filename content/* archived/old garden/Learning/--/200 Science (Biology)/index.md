# Honors Course Description
Biology is the study of the structure, growth, and function of the life systems of organisms. Students learn the basics of structures and functions of living things and how those structures and functions change. Data collection and analysis is a key skill emphasized in Biology in preparation for the End of Course (EOC) Exam that is required for graduation.

# **Grading Procedures:**
- 60% Summative:Tests, projects, and summative labs/reports
- 40% Formative: Daily work, homework, quizzes
## **Make Up Work:**
- _Formative:_ Students are responsible for obtaining make up work and coming to tutorials fro missing lesson(s). Students shall have time equal to the days absent from class plus, one day to complete all missed assignments. ALL FORMATIVE ASSIGNMENTS (HOMEWORK, CLASSWORK, LABS, and QUIZZES ARE DUE BEFORE THE SUMMATIVE (UNIT TEST). Assignments will NOT BE ACCEPTED after the summative.
- _Summative_: Students are responsible for making arrangements for makeup assessments during tutorial or eagle time. Must be taken before next summative or a grade of "zero" will stand.
## **Late Work:**
- When an assignment is submitted after a deadline, a penalty of fifteen (15) points per class meeting will be deducted from the grade with a maximum of thirty (30) points deducted. All late formative assignments are due BEFORE the summative assessment, and will not be accepted after.
## **Summative Re-Testing**  
- Any student receiving a grade below 75% on a summative may request to reassess.
- All retest requests must be made within 2 days of the summative grade being entered into the gradebook, via the re-test request Google Doc posted on Moodle.
- The retest MUST BE COMPLETED within 5 school days of the original summative (1 calendar week)
