- **Ecological Footprint and Urban Sustainability**
  - Cities have a large ecological footprint, consuming vast amounts of [[natural resources]] and impacting the environment significantly.
  - Urban sustainability aims to use resources without depleting them, facing challenges like suburban sprawl, providing clean water and air, climate change, and altering natural landscapes.

- **Urban Atmospheric Conditions**
  - Cities modify the natural environment by removing vegetation, changing landforms, and affecting air flow.
  - Urban areas experience higher temperatures, more fog and cloudiness, and increased atmospheric pollution compared to the countryside.
  - The phenomenon of urban heat islands results from hard surfaces and human activities, raising urban temperatures above those of surrounding areas.

- **Urban Water Usage and Runoff Patterns**
  - Cities are major consumers of water, with residential areas using the most.
  - [[Urbanization]] alters water runoff patterns, increasing the frequency and severity of flooding due to the replacement of vegetation with impermeable surfaces.

- **Urban Vegetation**
  - Contrary to previous beliefs, cities contain significant amounts of vegetation, which plays a crucial role in the urban ecosystem by influencing water quality, reducing temperature extremes, and providing habitats for wildlife.

- **The City’s Environmental Effects on Other Areas**
  - [[Urbanization]] can impact distant areas through increased consumption and demand for resources, such as transforming forests into grazing lands due to city dwellers' demands.

- **The Urban Footprint**
  - [[Urbanization]], often accompanied by industrialisation, stresses the natural environment by requiring large amounts of energy, food, and water.
  - The spatial extent of a city's impact on the environment is referred to as its urban footprint.

- **[[Dihydrogen Oxide|Water]] and Sanitation**
  - Many cities, especially in developing countries, face challenges with water supply and sanitation, including contaminated water sources and inadequate sewage systems.

- **Air Quality**
  - Urban areas suffer from air pollution due to high concentrations of automobiles and the use of solid fuels in low-income neighborhoods.

- **Energy**
  - Urban areas consume large amounts of energy, contributing to air pollution. Global energy consumption patterns vary, with some regions increasing their use of renewable sources.

- **Natural Disasters and Urban Risk**
  - Urban areas are vulnerable to natural disasters, which can be more destructive due to high population densities. The concept of the urban risk divide highlights disparities in disaster preparedness.

- **[[Urbanization]] and [[Sustainability]]**
  - Responses to environmental impacts vary, with some cities taking proactive measures to reduce emissions, encourage sustainable architecture, and adapt to climate change.

- **[[Brownfields|Brownfield]] Remediation and Redevelopment**
  - [[Brownfields|Brownfield]] sites, contaminated properties within cities, can be remediated and redeveloped for new uses, contributing to economic benefits and reducing [[Urban Sprawl]].

- **Farmland Protection Policy Act and Other Government Protections**
  - Policies and acts aim to protect farmland and control [[Urban Sprawl]], ensuring sustainable development.

- **Regional Planning Efforts**
  - Coordinated regional planning efforts are essential for addressing environmental impacts and promoting sustainable urban growth.
