# [[Migration]]'s Push and [[Pull Factor|Pull Factors]]
- [[Migration]] **is the permanent or semi-permanent relocation of people from one place to another.**
- First humans lived in Africa but early humans were very mobile, looking for nuts, seeds, and fruits to eat and animals to hunt
- **As agriculture and urban settlement developed, people began to settle down**

# Terminology
- **[[Immigration]] is [[Migration]] to a location** while **[[Emigration]] is [[Migration]] from a location**
- **The difference between immigrants and emigrants is called [[Net Migration]]**
- **If immigrants > emigrants, then the [[Net Migration]] is positive and has net in-[[Migration]]**
- **If immigrants < emigrants, then the [[Net Migration]] is negative and has net out-[[Migration]]**

# [[Migration]]'s Push and Pull Factors
- Usually [[Migration]] is **[[Voluntary Migration]], a movement in search of a better life.**
- The decision to move usually consists of **two main aspects**
	- **Away from someplace – [[Push Factor]]s (usually negative)**
	- **Toward someplace – [[Pull Factor]]s (usually positive)**

- **Social Push and [[Pull Factor|Pull Factors]]**
	- People often **migrate** when they experience **discrimination and persecution because of their [[Ethnicity]], [[Race]], [[Gender]], or religion.**
- **Political Push and [[Pull Factor|Pull Factors]]**
	- People who oppose the policies of the government often **migrate because they face persecution, arrest, and discrimination**
- **Economic Push and [[Pull Factor|Pull Factors]]**
	- The most common reason people **migrate is lack of jobs and economic opportunities.**
- **Environmental Push and Pull Factors
	- People often migrate to **escape harm from natural disasters, drought, and other unfavorable conditions**

## Intervening Obstacles
- Barriers that make reaching their desired destination more difficult
	- Economic – a migrant lacks enough money to reach a destination
	- Social – a migrant gets married to someone who lives along the [[Migration]] route and settles in that person’s community
	- Political – a migrant cannot get a visa needed to enter a country
	- Environmental – a migrant cannot cross sea, desert, or mountain range

# [[Forced Migration]]
- **[[Forced Migration]] is a permanent movement, usually compelled by cultural factors**
- Involves **[[Internally Displaced Person(s) (IDP)]], refugees, and asylum seekers**
## Displaced Persons and [[Refugee]]s
- **An [[Internally Displaced Person(s) (IDP)]] has been forced to migrate for similar political reasons as a [[Refugee]] but has not migrated across an international border.** (Ex. [[Trail of Tears]])
- **A [[Refugee]] is someone who is forced to migrate from his or her home country and cannot return for fear of persecution because of his or her [[Race]], religion, nationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion.**
	- [Montreal turns stadium into welcome centre for asylum seekers from US](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/02/canada-montreal-us-asylum-seekers-trump-refugees)
- **Largest numbers of refugees in 2014 were forced to migrate from Afghanistan and from Syria because of continuing civil wars. 
- **Neighboring countries received most of them – Pakistan and Iran from Afghanistan and Lebanon and Turkey from Syria**
- An asylum seeker is **someone who has migrated to another country in hope of being recognized as a [[Refugee]]**
- **Colonization** is **“the action or process of settling among and establishing control over the indigenous people of an area.”** The rate and breadth (span) of [[Migration]] increased drastically during the Age of Exploration. 
- **As countries like Spain, France, Portugal, and Great Britain searched for new resources and new transportation routes around the world, they spread their cultural influences, causing the mass [[Forced Migration]] of African people.**

## [[Migration]] Policies and their Consequences
- While some countries **encourage [[Immigration]], others actively restricted the flow of [[Migration]] into their countries**
- Some countries have **relied heavily on immigrants to improve their economy but many people have cultural biases against immigrants and try to keep them out**
### **Policies Encouraging [[Immigration]]**
- **Few U.S. policies restricting [[Immigration]] before the 1880s**
- **Farms needed laborers – immigrants were welcomed**
- **Homestead Act (1862) – government gave land to settlers willing to farm it for 5 years**
- **Currently, the U.S. gives visas to well-educated migrants to encourage them to stay**
- **[[Guest Worker]] programs – hard, unpleasant work**
- **Family reunification policies – sponsor family members**
- Other policies: **quick [[Migration]] for refugees in emergency situations and foreign college students may become permanent residents after graduation**
### Policies Discouraging [[Immigration]]
**- Some countries establish educational standards or restrict the kind of work they can do** 
**- [[Immigration]] quotas – Emergency Quota Act of 1921 (<3%) or [[Immigration]] Act of 1924 (<2%)**
**- Some policies reflect xenophobia – a strong dislike of people who practice another culture**
**- Economics – immigrants will take jobs**
- In the U.S., **xenophobia and economics led to the passing of the Chinese Exclusion Act**
**- Japan – preserve cultural homogeneity**
