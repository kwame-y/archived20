**Introduction**
- Bid-rent theory and von Thünen's model help explain spatial distributions in agriculture.
- Von Thünen combined bid-rent theory with transportation cost to understand agricultural distribution.
**Underlying Assumptions**
- Von Thünen's model relies on several assumptions:
   - No trade connections outside the modeled area.
   - One central market.
   - Uniform soil, climate, and flat terrain.
   - Equal farmer access to the market and profit maximization.
**Von Thünen's Original Model (1820s)**
- Divided into four concentric zones:
   - I: Dairy farming and market gardening
   - II: Forest for wood
   - III: Grains and field crops
   - IV: Ranching
- Reflects agricultural practices' relation to transportation costs and perishability.
**Revised Model with River**
- Improved transportation via navigable rivers influenced model adjustments.
- Dairy farming and market gardening follow river courses, extending outward from the center.
**Historic Patterns of Agricultural Production**
- Application to 1820s New York City shows similar patterns observed by von Thünen.
- Dairy farms near the city, grain farming in the hinterland.
- Transportation developments, like railroads, alter agricultural landscapes.
**Application of Bid-Rent Theory**
- Land values increase closer to the market due to transportation efficiencies.
- Railroads boost property values, facilitating perishable goods transportation.
**Contemporary Application**
- Today's agriculture influenced by factors beyond transportation.
- Von Thünen's model adapted to local, national, regional, and global scales.
- Climate and specialty crops alter model predictions; scale impacts analysis accuracy.
**Conclusion**
- Von Thünen's model useful for studying commercial agriculture distribution.
- Adjustments needed for specialty agriculture and varying scales of analysis.
- Model's strength lies in examining regional patterns despite limitations in predicting all agricultural practices.
