## Origin and Function of Cities
  - ==Early human societies were nomadic before settling into agricultural villages near fertile river valleys.==
  - Permanent settlements allowed for the development of cities as populations grew and people engaged in non-agricultural activities.
### Agricultural Surplus and Socioeconomic Stratification
- Improved farming methods led to surplus production, supporting larger populations and specialization in occupations other than [[agriculture]].
- Socioeconomic stratification emerged, with the development of distinct social classes and early forms of government to manage resources and social relations.
## Major [[Urban Hearths|Urban Hearth]] Areas
  - The first cities appeared in regions like [[Mesopotamia]], the Nile River valley, the Indus River valley, China, Mesoamerica, the Andean highlands, and West Africa.
>These cities were small by today's standards but had ==high population densities==.
### [[Site]] & [[Situation]]
  - ==**[[Site]]**: The physical features of a location, such as terrain and [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]] sources, were crucial for early city development.==
  - ==**[[Situation]]**: The [[relative location]] concerning surrounding features, like trade routes and resources, influenced urban growth and decline over time.==
## Diffusion of Urbanisation
  >Cities spread from their original [[hearth]] areas through spontaneous development and the influence of empires and trade.
  - **[[Europe]]**: The Greek and Roman Empires played significant roles in spreading [[urbanization]] through conquest and trade, with infrastructure like aqueducts and roads facilitating city growth.
## Rural-to-Urban Migration
>==Urban growth results from [[migration]] from rural areas and natural population increase, with industrialisation and capitalism driving [[migration]] in [[Europe]] and [[North America]].==
- **China**: Policy reforms in the late 20th century encouraged [[migration]] from rural areas to cities, contributing to rapid urbanisation.
- **Africa and [[Asia]]**: [[Migration]] is often driven by the search for better opportunities or forced by adverse conditions, leading to urban growth despite challenges like low-skilled employment and poverty.
## Transportation and Communication
  - Innovations like railroads, streetcars, automobiles, and communication technologies (telegraph, telephone, Internet) have significantly influenced urban development by enhancing mobility and connectivity.
