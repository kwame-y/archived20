## Women in the Subsistence Agriculture Labour Force
- In subsistence economies, harvested food is shared among families, with women playing a crucial role in plant-based food production.
- Women contribute significantly to food production, distribution, and consumption by planting, harvesting, and preparing food in subsistence societies.
- Studies on women's roles in agriculture vary, making comparisons hard due to differences in data collection methods.
- The Green Revolution has allowed some subsistence societies to produce a surplus for sale, complicating distinctions between family consumption and market sales.
- Women's participation in agriculture increases when men leave villages for urban employment, but determining the specific tasks and time allocation remains challenging.
- Studies from CropLife International and the World Bank show variations in women's agricultural roles across different regions, with an estimated average of 45 percent of the agricultural workforce being women in developing countries.
### Subsistence Agriculture Roles by Type
1. **Mixed Crop/Livestock Farming:**
   - Women in these societies handle crops and livestock near the homestead.
   - Responsibilities include feeding animals, managing calves, cleaning barns, milking, and making butter and cheese.
   - Women influence the use of eggs, milk, and poultry for family consumption and may market surplus products.
2. **Shifting Cultivation:**
   - Women in tropical forests sow seeds and harvest crops, adapting to traditional practices.
   - Globalization has led women to engage in craft production for income due to insufficient subsistence crop yields.
3. **Paddy Rice Farming:**
   - Women primarily handle planting, thinning, weeding, harvesting, and processing rice by hand.
   - Gender roles may vary across regions, with women having more active roles in some areas.
4. **Nomadic Pastoralism:**
   - In male-dominated pastoralist societies, women's involvement is limited, focusing on tasks like milking.
   - Drought conditions in some regions have shifted responsibilities, giving women more control during men's absence.
### Challenges in Subsistence Agriculture
- Cultural barriers limit women's management roles in farm operations.
- Limited access to technologies, including the Green Revolution, hinders women's success in farming.
- [[United Nations]] initiatives aim to empower women in agriculture, recognizing the need for both men and women to be involved.
## Women in the Commercial Agriculture Labour Force
- Commercial agriculture, evolving with the Industrial Revolution, saw changing roles for women as farming became more mechanized.
- Women's roles in commercial agriculture in developed countries vary, with the overall proportion of women farm managers around 28 percent in the [[European Union]].
- In the United States, 36 percent of farms are owned by women, with variations in different regions and ages.
### Challenges in Commercial Agriculture
- Gender stereotypes persist in commercial agriculture, impacting women's authority over their farms.
- Younger women face hurdles, but rural development funds and policies support their entry into agriculture.
## Similarities and Differences: A Summary
1. **Formal Division of Labour:**
   - Subsistence societies have a formal division of labour based on culture and gender.
   - Commercial societies face gender role stereotypes, which are comparatively easier to address.
2. **Land Ownership and Access to Technology:**
   - Women in subsistence societies lack full ownership of land, crops, and livestock, limiting management.
   - Women in commercial agriculture can purchase land and have access to advanced technologies.
3. **Access to Programs:**
   - Both subsistence and commercial agricultural regions have programs enhancing women's roles.
   - [[United Nations]] and other organizations collaborate to teach farming techniques and provide technology in developing societies.
4. **Increasing Women Farmers:**
   - The number of women farmers is increasing in both subsistence and commercial farming, contributing to global food security.
