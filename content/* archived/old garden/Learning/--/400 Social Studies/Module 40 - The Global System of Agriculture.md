**Globalization and Agriculture**
- [[Globalization]] integrates economic, political, and social processes worldwide.
- ***Agricultural production depends on local conditions but is increasingly distributed and consumed globally.***
- Intensifying interdependence exists among local production, supply chains, and global consumption.
**The Global Supply Chain**
- Agribusinesses organized globally cover growing, harvesting, processing, transporting, marketing, and consumption.
- [[Industrialisation]] and transportation have fueled the emergence of the global supply chain.
- Green Revolution grains and cash crops dominate, reducing diet diversity.
**Interdependence of Production and Consumption**
- A few multinational corporations dominate the global supply chain, controlling multiple stages.
- Contract farming is common, with farmers producing for global markets under agribusiness contracts.
- Farmers' access to markets relies heavily on multinational agribusinesses.
**Globalization of Production and Consumption**
- Few multinationals control a significant portion of agricultural production, influencing markets.
- Changes in consumer preferences impact global consumption patterns.
- Emerging producers challenge traditional dominance in global markets.
**Export Commodities**
- Export commodities, grown for wealthier countries, often displace local food production.
- Dependency on export commodities can leave countries vulnerable to crop failures and changing market trends.
**Impacts on Producing Countries**
- Dependency on export commodities can lead to economic vulnerability and food insecurity.
- ==Historical examples like sugar in the Caribbean and coffee production illustrate the risks.==
**Political Relationships**
- International political economics, rather than food shortages, primarily cause hunger.
- Government policies and infrastructure impact agricultural production and trade.
**Infrastructure**
- Colonial infrastructure has typically prioritized the export of goods over local needs, exacerbating food insecurity.
- Infrastructure issues persist in economically undeveloped regions, affecting food production and distribution.
**Patterns of Worldwide Trade**
- Historical trade patterns have evolved into modern global agribusiness networks.
- Regional trade agreements and the involvement of agribusinesses shape global agricultural trade.
- Fluctuations in trade result from changing consumer tastes and competition.
