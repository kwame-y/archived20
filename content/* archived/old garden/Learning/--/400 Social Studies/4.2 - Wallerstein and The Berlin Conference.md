# Wallerstein’s Core-Periphery Systems Model
- World system theory
- Breaks countries into [[Core States]], [[Periphery States]], and [[Semi-Periphery States]] 
- **Roles may have changed over time—theory based on 1970s**

# [[Module 21#Colonialism and Imperialism|Colonialism]] and the **Berlin Conference**
- European countries wanted to be empires **([[Module 21#Colonialism and Imperialism|imperialism]])**, so they either settled in new places or took the [[Natural Resources|resources]] from new places **([[Module 21#Colonialism and Imperialism|colonialism]])**.
	- **They don’t want to waste money on wars with each other, so they try to peacefully establish “spheres of influence”.**
- At this conference in Berlin in 1884, they divided up Africa.
	- Example of **[[Core States|core states]]** and their relationship to **[[Periphery States|peripheral states]].**
# Scramble for Africa
![[Colonial_Africa_1913_map.svg]]
- No African role/say in mapping.
- Their goal was to divide resource-rich land and coastal land for transport.
- These lines **divided ethnicities (shared ancestry and cultural tradition, leading to shared identity).**
	- These ethnicities, as they gain a desire for recognition and self-determination, form nationalities ([[Nation|nations]]).
# [[Nation|Nations]]
- The **foundation of most [[Nation|nations]] is a shared [[Ethnicity]], but may also be related to a shared religion, language, or other attributes like historical bonds.**
- **[[Nation|Nations]] seek some degree of recognition,** often political autonomy or greater control within the [[Region]] they live.
# [[State|States]]
- ==Remember: states = countries.==
![[Colonial_Africa_1913_map.svg]]
- The black lines on the map show where the states (countries) of Africa currently exist.
- The colours on the white map show which European state-controlled these territories.
- These **states had to be recognized by many countries, including the one on the map** (i.e., the one that used to control that territory.)

**Belgian (yellow), British (red), French (blue), German (aquamarine), Italian (lime green), Portuguese (purple), and Spanish (pink) empires.**
