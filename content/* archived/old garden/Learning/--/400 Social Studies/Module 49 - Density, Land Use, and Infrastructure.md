### Patterns of Urban Land Use
- Urban land use is influenced by utility (usefulness) and accessibility (ease of transportation).
- Early cities were unplanned, with homes and businesses established without a future city structure in mind.
- City models, such as the sector model and the multiple-nuclei model, help understand city structure, land-use patterns, and population density, though no model fits any city precisely.

### Early Travel to and Within Cities
- Initially, cities were compact, with most travel on foot. Long-distance travel was by boats, horses, or stagecoaches.
- Industrialisation led to the expansion of cities and the development of mass transit systems like horse cars, cable cars, railroads, and electric streetcars or trolleys.
- These transit systems influenced the development of residential and industrial areas, making land along transportation lines more valuable.

### The Rise of Automotive Transportation
- By the 1950s, automotive transportation became dominant, leading to the decline of mass transit systems and the expansion of cities.
- This shift changed urban land use, with lower-order commercial establishments and high-density apartment buildings developing around highway interchanges and major transfer points.

### Population and Housing Density and Residential Land-Use Patterns
- Population density is the total population divided by total land area, while perceived density is based on qualitative data.
- The population density gradient shows that density decreases as distance from the city center increases, influenced by local [[Zoning Laws|zoning regulations]].

### Changes in Residential Building Density
- Increases in population density are largely due to increases in the numbers of residential buildings, especially in areas close to city centers like Manhattan.

### Sociocultural Patterns
- Social classes began spatially separating as early as the nineteenth century, with high-income residences located at the city's periphery and low-income residences in the center.
- This separation often coincided with racial, ethnic, and linguistic differences.

### Infrastructure and the Fiscal Squeeze
- Economic restructuring and metropolitan [[decentralization]] have led to a fiscal squeeze, where city revenues cannot keep up with the demand for services and infrastructure maintenance.
- Cities struggle with decreasing tax bases as residential populations and commercial establishments move to suburban areas.

### Changes in the Economic Base and Housing Patterns
- The industrial economic base has given way to a new economy based on digital technologies, affecting urban areas' types of jobs and housing patterns.
- High-income residents returning to city centers have displaced lower-income residents, increasing homelessness due to a lack of affordable housing.
