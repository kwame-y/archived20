- Sustainable development aims to meet present consumption needs without jeopardizing future generations' ability to meet theirs.
- [[Industrialisation]] consumes [[natural resources]], leading to depletion and contamination of air and [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]].
## Resource Depletion
- Resource depletion includes both renewable and nonrenewable resources.
- Common forms of resource depletion: mining, deforestation, soil erosion, aquifer depletion, overfishing.
- Industrial manufacturing primarily relies on nonrenewable resources.
- Industrial agriculture contributes to resource depletion, particularly through water usage and deforestation.
- The rapid depletion of resources questions the [[sustainability]] of current mass-consumption habits globally.
## Environmental Pollution
- Environmental pollution negatively impacts the physical and biological components of the environment.
- Pollution sources categorized into point sources (e.g., factories) and nonpoint sources (e.g., runoff).
- Factories release various chemicals into the atmosphere and water bodies, posing risks to human and aquatic life.
- Nonpoint sources of pollution include runoff from agriculture, mining, and urban areas.
## Climate Change Effects
- Climate change involves long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns.
- Human activities, notably [[Industrialisation]], have significantly contributed to climate change.
- CO2 emissions from combustion, particularly from fossil fuels, are a primary human-generated source of atmospheric CO2.
- [[Industrialisation]] has led to a dramatic increase in atmospheric CO2 levels, causing a rise in global temperatures.
- Climate change effects include rising sea levels, coastal flooding, stronger hurricanes, prolonged droughts, and more severe heat waves.

## **Conserving [[Natural Resources]]**
  - Following the 4 R's: reduce, reuse, recycle, and rethink to slow resource depletion.
  - Techniques for reducing resource consumption include using efficient methods in industrial agriculture and conserving energy in consumer activities.
  - Reusing and recycling resources, such as establishing cogeneration facilities and utilizing recycled materials.
  - Rethinking approaches to achieve environmentally sustainable and socially just economic development.
  
## Reducing Pollution
  - Government regulations, like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act in the United States, significantly reduced industrial pollution.
  - Standards set for emissions and wastewater reduced toxic contaminants in the air and water.
  - Despite successes in developed countries, some rapidly developing nations lack adequate pollution laws, leading to severe air and water pollution in cities like Beijing, Jakarta, and New Delhi.
## Carbon-Neutral Industrialisation
  - Aim for carbon neutrality through emissions reduction and carbon removal efforts.
  - Many countries, including France, New Zealand, and Norway, aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
  - Carbon removal methods include carbon offsets, such as forest conservation and reforestation projects.
  - Emissions reductions involve transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like hydroelectric, solar, and wind power.
# Introduction to Ecotourism
  - Proposal of ecotourism as an economic development strategy for developing countries.
  - Definition: Ecotourism is travel to natural areas supporting conservation efforts and socially just economic development.
  - Sustainable management of lodging and facilities using renewable energy, waste recycling, and water conservation.
## Economic Aspect of Ecotourism
  - Natural landscapes like forests and marine ecosystems can bring sustained economic growth if protected.
  - Revenue from ecotourism directly contributes to local conservation efforts.
## Social Component of Ecotourism
  - Emphasizes cultural and environmental education for both tourists and local residents.
  - Tourists gain a deeper understanding of the destination's people, place, and environment.
  - Creation of new jobs empowers local residents as guides and hosts.
  - Significant portion of ecotourism revenue should benefit the local community.
## Chumbe Island Coral Park
  - Example of a successful ecotourism destination in Tanzania.
  - Attractions include protected coral reef, tropical forest, and rare wildlife.
  - Sustainable lodging with locally sourced materials, composting toilets, and solar-powered lighting.
  - Support for local community through purchasing supplies from local farmers and artisans.
  - Provision of environmental education and community outreach programs.
## Ecotourism as an Economic Development Alternative
  - Tourism based on natural landscapes for economic development.
  - Ecotourism: Defined as travel to natural areas in support of conservation and socially just economic development.
  - Sustainability Practices: Lodging and facilities designed and managed sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, waste recycling, and water conservation.
  - Economic Logic: Protecting natural landscapes can bring sustained economic growth; revenue from ecotourism supports local conservation efforts.
  - Social Component: Cultural and environmental education aspects for tourists; creation of local jobs and empowerment of residents as guides and hosts.
  - Example: Chumbe Island Coral Park in Tanzania showcases successful ecotourism practices.
## The Limits of Ecotourism
  - Profit Distribution: Large international corporations dominate the tourism industry, taking the majority of profits; limited contribution to destination countries' GDP.
  - Job Nature: Majority of jobs created are low-skilled and low-wage.
  - Environmental Impact:
    - [[City Scale|Local Scale]]: Positive effect on wildlife and landscape preservation, but lodging may have negative environmental impacts.
    - [[Regional Scale]]: Transportation infrastructure can have negative environmental impacts similar to fossil fuel-based transportation systems.
    - [[Global Scale]]: Reliance on passenger jets contributes to global warming.
# [[United Nations|UN]] Sustainable Development Goals
- Establishment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the [[United Nations]] in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
- Transition towards a holistic approach considering human well-being and environmental sustainability.
- 17 SDGs aimed at ending poverty, protecting the environment, and achieving prosperity for all countries by 2030.
- Reflects a shift from purely economic understanding of development.
## Measuring Progress
- Principal means for evaluating and comparing countries' development status.
- High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) monitors progress.
- Sustainable Development Report provides annual review of 193 [[United Nations|UN]] member states' performances on SDGs.
- Data collection involves complex methods and relies on voluntary cooperation.
- Examples of indicators for SDG 11, "Sustainable Cities and Communities," demonstrate the complexity of measurements involved.
- Comprehensive assessment provides a single score ranging from 0 to 100 for each country.
- Denmark ranked highest in 2019 report with a score of 85, while the Central African Republic ranked lowest with a score of 39.
- Challenges highlighted in the 2019 report include income inequalities, health and education gaps, climate change, and biodiversity conservation.
- Encouraging signs observed in renewable resource power generation and ecotourism contributing to sustainable development.
- Global monitoring and assessment crucial for keeping countries focused on SDGs.
