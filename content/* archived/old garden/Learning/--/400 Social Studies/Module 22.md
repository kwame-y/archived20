# Notes
## Cultural Identities
- [[Globalization]], an ongoing and centuries-spanning process, is of particular importance when examining culture, [[Ethnicity]], and [[Race]] from historical and global perspectives. 
	- Shared elements such as language, religion, and [[Ethnicity]] create a deep-seated sense of a common history and destiny among various groups, forming the bedrock of national identity.
	- For instance, Israel's identity as a Jewish nation, characterized by a shared religious and cultural identity, Turkey's unity through a common language, and Japan's unique cultural traditions set the stage for people within these nations to coalesce into political entities.
- However, long-standing tensions often exist with groups residing within these borders, whose beliefs or practices differ from the cultural mainstream, as seen in Israel's Palestinian population, Turkey's Kurdish-speaking minority, and Japan's indigenous Ainu people.
- These ethnic groups frequently self-identify or are identified by others based on their cultural distinctions from the dominant cultural group, further highlighting the complexities of cultural identity and affiliation.

## [[Urbanization]] and Cultural Processes
- In addition to [[globalisation]], there are various ongoing processes that continue to shape cultures worldwide, one of which is [[urbanization]].
- Urban centers serve as sources of inspiration for popular cultures, influencing the [[Cultural Landscape]] both locally and globally.
	- For example, South Korea's capital city, Seoul, exerts a profound influence on emerging cultural trends, music, and fashions, representing a prime example of the cultural impact of urban hierarchies.
- The well-known K-pop single "Gangnam Style," referring to an upscale neighborhood in Seoul, illustrates how a city like Seoul can encapsulate the essence of an entire culture for outsiders.
- [[Urbanization]] also transforms and modernizes traditional cultural elements, as seen in the preservation of Japanese heritage tied to fishing villages, despite a majority of the population now residing in cities.

## Globalization and Local Indigenous Cultures
- The interplay between globalisation and local indigenous cultures leads to both opportunities and challenges for these communities.
  - On one hand, new global communications systems, global governance institutions, and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) provide indigenous peoples with unprecedented networking possibilities.
  - These networks enable indigenous communities worldwide to share strategies, rally international support for local causes, and unite to safeguard their cultural survival.
  - Conversely, globalisation also exposes isolated indigenous cultures to new values and poses threats to their local economies and environments.
  - Multinational corporations, in their pursuit of new markets and resources, can potentially disrupt the local economies and environments of indigenous communities.
  - The World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Cancún, Mexico in 2003 illustrates the complexities of this interaction, as indigenous groups from around the world converged to strategize ways to further their cultural survival, gain international recognition, and protest the WTO's vision of globalisation.
  - The International Cancún Declaration of Indigenous Peoples emerged from this meeting, expressing criticism of prevailing globalisation trends.

## Cultural Diffusion from and Resistance to Globalization
- Cultural differences are not always a source of conflict or oppression; often, ethnic or racial distinctiveness is a source of pride.
  - However, as the world becomes more interconnected through advancements in communication and transportation, the distinctive markers of [[Ethnicity]] may face external pressures, leading to debates on the influence of Western cultural practices on indigenous populations.
  - A resurgence of ethnic identity, particularly among indigenous groups, has been notable in the late 20th century.
  - These groups, as well as ethnic minorities, face challenges in asserting their identities in the majority society.
  - Young people, regardless of [[Ethnicity]], often feel the pressure to conform to the mainstream and may hide elements that distinguish them from the dominant culture, such as language, dress, religion, or cuisine.
  - For example, the Japanese-Brazilian community formed through Japanese [[Immigration]] to Brazil exemplifies the complexities of ethnic identity and adaptation to globalisation, with Brazil's Nikkeijin population known for its resistance to [[Assimilation]].
  - The influence of globalisation is complex and depends on how it is structured and who benefits from it, and this interaction is shaping the identities of indigenous and ethnic minority groups in multifaceted ways.

## Language and Technology
- The Internet, a major technological advancement, profoundly influences global culture and communication, especially the English language's dominant role.
  - English's current dominance on the Internet is not uniform, and people often communicate online using modified forms of the language, such as abbreviations and symbols that convey emotional nuances.
  - English, an alphabetic writing system, typically requires a significant number of keystrokes to express common phrases, leading to the use of abbreviations like "LOL," "SMH," and "TBH" in text messaging and online communication.
  - The prevalence of logographic writing, represented by characters that convey entire words, such as in the Chinese language, further highlights the adaptation of writing systems in the online world.
  - Symbols like ☺ and ♥, known as emojis, convey emotions in a universal manner, transcending language barriers. Different languages and cultures employ their own variations, such as ^^ in Korean and -_- in another language.
  - The influence of texting shortcuts is extending beyond online communication, affecting spoken and written English, with abbreviations like "LOL" now commonly used in speech.
  - The increase in globalisation, mobility, and digital communication technologies is leading to changes in languages, both in written and spoken forms, across the world.

## Endangered Languages
- Language preservation is essential for maintaining cultural diversity, as language serves as the primary means of expressing culture.
- Many languages are classified as endangered or extinct, with endangered languages at risk of disappearing from everyday use.
- The use of technology, such as language apps and social media, plays a crucial role in language preservation, connecting speakers and promoting language use, especially among younger generations.
- For example, Native American groups collaborate with software developers to create language apps for smartphones and tablets, as well as toys and video games that use their native languages.
- The Internet and various digital platforms, such as Facebook, texting, video chats, and YouTube, contribute to the preservation and revival of endangered languages, engaging younger generations in their cultural and linguistic heritage.
- Language immersion schools, often with mentor relationships between elders and youth, serve as vital tools for language preservation.
- Funding from government sources and tribal initiatives supports these efforts, as many Native American groups are actively involved in language preservation and instruction.

## Cultural Convergence
- Globalization directly and visibly influences [[Popular Culture]], with various factors such as increased leisure time, instant communication, greater affluence, heightened mobility, and weakened local attachments contributing to massive spatial restructuring.
- The convergence [[hypothesis]] suggests that cultures are gradually becoming more alike, potentially leading to a sense of [[Placelessness]] and the creation of similar cultural landscapes in many places.
- However, it is essential to recognize that efforts to create a sense of place can counteract [[Placelessness]], preserving local distinctiveness in the face of globalizing forces.
  
## Cultural Divergence
- Globalization is an ongoing and incomplete process, with cultural differences not simply being obliterated by its wave.
- Cultural practices rooted in place significantly shape the effects of globalisation, leading to various responses, including resistance, transformation, and adaptation.
- Communities respond differently to globalisation, rejecting some aspects while embracing others, as seen in the adoption of glocalization policies by many businesses.
- For example, global fast-food chains often modify their menus to cater to local food tastes and religious beliefs.
- The expansion of global brands, like McDonald's and KFC, into different countries reflects globalisation but does not necessarily erase long-standing cultural traditions.
- Indeed, globalisation can potentially revitalize local cultural differences when people decide that certain elements of their culture are worth preserving.
- The same forces that drive cultural convergence in some instances can lead to cultural divergences in different geographic contexts, shaping the complex and multifaceted nature of cultural change in the modern world.
- Transportation and communication technologies have accelerated and reshaped cultural patterns, with geographic concepts remaining foundational for understanding the cultural context of places around the world.
