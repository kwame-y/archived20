## Urban Systems
- Urban systems consist of interdependent cities connected by networks of goods, services, ideas, money, and labor.
- Territories are organized into a pattern of towns, cities, and their hinterlands.
## [[Rank-Size Rule]]
- ==Settlement populations are inversely proportional to their rank in the urban hierarchy.==
- *The second-largest city has about half the population of the largest city, the third-largest has one-third, and so on.*
## [[Primate city|Primate Cities]]
- **A [[primate city]] is significantly larger than the next largest city and dominates the country's economic, political, and cultural life.**
- Examples include [[Lagos]] in [[Nigeria]] and [[London]] in the [[UK]].
## Christaller’s [[Central Place Theory]]
- [[Central place theory]] explains the distribution of cities based on their role in providing goods and services.
- Settlements are organized hierarchically, with larger cities spaced farther apart due to their ability to draw people from greater distances for high-order goods and services.
### Assumptions of [[Central Place Theory]]
1. The region's surface is flat with no physical barriers.
2. Soil quality is consistent everywhere.
3. Population and purchasing power are evenly distributed.
4. Uniform transportation networks exist.
5. Goods and services can be sold in all directions to a certain distance.
### Hierarchy of Central Places
- First-order places: Large regional cities (e.g., New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles).
- Second-order places: Smaller cities with regional importance (e.g., Boston, Seattle, Atlanta).
- Third-order places: Towns with subregional importance.
- Fourth-order places: Small villages and hamlets with local importance.
## Modern Urban Systems
- Modern urban systems often deviate from Christaller's model due to technological, communication, and transportation advances.
- The importance of cities can rise or fall based on their location and relevance to the modern economy (e.g., San Francisco vs. Oakland).
### The Gravity Model
- Predicts interaction between places based on population size and distance.
- Interaction decreases as distance increases.
- Used by urban planners for [[migration]] studies and transportation planning.
- Controversial as a predictive tool and may perpetuate undesirable patterns.
### [[Central Place Theory]] Now
- [[Central place theory]]'s relevance is questioned in the modern context.
- Urban landscapes change, with some cities declining and others rising.
- [[Edge Cities]] and [[Exurbs]] develop, altering the traditional urban hierarchy.
- Technology and communication networks influence the growth of cities.
