# The Industrial Revolution
>The rapid transformation of the economy through the introduction of machines, new power sources, and new chemical processes in [[Europe]] and the United States between 1760 and 1830

 - Before the Industrial Revolution, society and culture was mostly rural and agricultural. 
 - Cities existed—as centers of political power, education, and innovation—but most people lived in the countryside, obtaining their food through [[agriculture]].
## Origins and Preconditions
- **In the early 1700s, conditions in Great Britain provided a perfect jumpstart for the Industrial Revolution.**
	- **Agricultural advancements increased food production and reduced the demand for agricultural workers.**
		- This caused a movement of poor, unemployed people into the cities, giving factories a large labour force to work with
	- **Great Britain’s damp, cool climate was perfect for producing sheep’s wool.**
		- Which was in turn used to increase textile production
			- Great Britain traditionally produced textiles
	- **Great Britain was the world’s trade leader in the eighteenth century.**
		- This was due to it's dominant naval power
		- Large amount of colonies
		- And it's monopolized trade with many parts of the globe
	- **New wealth provided extra money needed to support innovations in industry, transportation, and energy.**
		- New machines and ideas brought investment, allowing for more advances in technology and more improvements in labor productivity
![[Slave Trade Money Britain.png]]
## Early Mechanisation
- **[[Industrialisation]] started in Britain’s textile manufacturing, centered at that the Lancashire district in northwestern England.** 
- Changes started small but slowly grew in impact
	- Craftsmen invented mechanical spinners and looms, and people channeled flowing [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]] to power the new machines in textile mills. 
	- ==The spinning jenny allowed a single worker to manage multiple looms at a time, increasing productivity and amount of goods produced per worker per unit of time==
	- ![[Spinning Jenny Lady.png]]
	- The Industrial Revolution led to the development of new transportation such as steel vessels by steam engines & railroad.
		- Said systems allowed the diffusion of ideas & practices including the Industrial Revolution
# Diffusion of the Industrial Revolution
- Great Britain maintained a monopoly on the Industrial Revolution into the 1800s.
	- They tried their best to prevent diffusion of their inventions, giving Britain a huge economic advantage
- Technology still diffused in to [[Europe]]
	- Second Half of the 19th century(1850-1900), it diffused in to Belgium & Germany and other northwestern/central European countries
	- The US adopted railroads in 1850
	- ==Japan in 1900(aka the first non-western country to go under [[Industrialisation]])==
	- Early 20th(1900-1930) [[Industrialisation]] spread to Russia & Ukraine
![[Diffusion of Industrial Revolution.png]]
# [[Fossil Fuels]]
> ==**[[Industrialisation]] depends on a steady and reliable source of [[natural resources]]**==, which provide power sources and raw material inputs in manufacturing processes.
- In the early parts of the industrial revolution, being close to [[natural resources]] was important
	- But innovations in transportation(trains, steamboats, etc.) allowed manufacturing to be further away from resources
- The first stage of [[Industrialisation|Industrialisation]] had manufacturing areas rural and far apart as they had to be close to power sources(wood & [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]]) & [[natural resources]]
	- Places near [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]] were perfect for the textile industry as [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]] was channeled to power looms([[spinning jenny]])
	- Charcoal was used for power furnaces in smelting
- Innovations in the mid-1700s improved the steam engine and caused a shift of power supply from wood & [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]] to coal
>	Fossil fuels are natural fuels derived from the fossilized remains of living organisms. Coal, crude oil, and natural gas are all examples of fossil fuels.
- Coal has more energy than wood and allowed factories & manufacturers to move into cities for better suited labor & transportation
	- As a side effect, they started to cluster([[agglomeration]])
- Coal is difficult to transport so steelmaking factories clustered around coal fields
	- Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is located in the middle of multiple coalfields, making it the most productive steelmaking [[region]] in the world
	- Canals & railroads still allowed coal to be available far from mines, to cut costs companies stayed near coalfields
# Raw Materials Inputs
>[[Natural resources]] give a source of raw materials for manufacturing
- [[Iron]] Ore → [[Iron]] → Steel
- Coalfields → Coke → used for furnace fuel and making [[iron]]
	- Pittsburg's location in the middle of 3 rivers allowed it to gain lots of [[iron]] ore from the great lakes
- Everything needs a raw resourced to be refined to make things
	- factories needed lumber, stone, sand, brick, clay, & limestone to make
	- Machines were made from steel
# Increased Food Supplies & Population
>The Industrial Revolution transformed individual and social life. Not only did it greatly alter our daily activities, from how and where we obtained our food to how and where we lived, but it also changed our sense of self in relation to the world.
- The innovations leading up to the industrial revolution increased food supplies in England & western Europe
	- Crop Rotation
	- Lots of small fields → Single Big Farms
		- Because new farming machines needed more land to be effective, therefore causing even more productivity
	- More efficient tools & labor
		- [[Iron]]-tipped plows
	- Fertiliser
	- Steam-powered tractors
- The increased amount of food outgrew population growth
	- But also caused large population growth
	- Great Britian went from 10.8 million in 1801 to 37.1 million in 1901
	- Malnutrition & famines occured due to the bad distribution of food instead of nlack of food
# Rural → [[Urban]] [[Migration]]
>The increasing [[Industrialisation]] of agriculture pushed rural dwellers off their land. Farmland consolidation and increased productivity through mechanization meant fewer jobs and fewer places to live in rural areas. Rural residents had little choice but to leave. Industrial manufacturing, increasingly consolidated in and around cities, became the destination for uprooted rural dwellers, who could earn money by working in city factories. Urbanization accelerated dramatically.
- [[Urbanization]] is the process of concentrating larger populations into cities
	- Caused by [[Industrialisation|Industrialisation]]
	- Before the industrial revolution, over 80% of the British were rural, by 1850 most people lived in cities
		- For murica it was 1900
- Urbanization was caused by rapid population growth in existing cities
	- London from 2 → 5 million in 1840 → 1880
- And small towns becoming industrial centers
	- Manchester, England went from 20,000 in 1770s onward to 180,000 in 1820
	- This was because of it's cool climate
	- It was close to a seaport & coalfields(steel production? & fuel)
	- all of this caused it to become a textile manufacturing giant
- Urbanization happened too fast for [[infrastructure|infrastructure]] to be put into place
	- Big cities were often dirty, crowded, sick
# New Social & Spatial Forms
>The changes to society resulting from the Industrial Revolution were so extensive that we can touch only upon the most important. At the most general level, [[Industrialisation]] led to a new kind of economy with a new way of organizing society, industrial capitalism. A capitalist system implies a new set of social classes and a new set of relationships between them.
## Social Classes & Class Relations
- Landowners who gained more & more farmland and invested in [[Mechanization|Mechanization]] became a new class of commercial farmers
	- They raise food & animals for money
- Workers who were displaced because of the consolidation had to sell labor for money
	- Wage labor is when someone pays a worker to do something, usually by day or hour
	- These people became the working class
- The employers became the capitalist class
- Later in the Industrial Revolution the middle class came
	- Made up of salaried professionals(go college, make money)
		- lawyers, educators, and physicians, and office workers, such as bank tellers and store clerks.
- People lived nearer others of the same class & shared similar lives([[Centripetal Force]])
	- Clothings, food, belief, norms, taboos, behaviour
- There was tension
	- Workers wanted better conditions and more money, so they made unions in order to bargain with capitalists
## New Divisions of Labor
>All societies have some means of dividing up tasks among people. At the most basic level, tasks are divided among members based primarily on age and gender.
- Assembly lines allowed for mass production of goods as each worker had one specific job in order to make a final product
## Effects on the Family
>In preindustrial society, agricultural families tended to organize themselves as a single unit of production. Women, men, and children were all involved in producing for the household. Even the youngest children contributed by tending livestock or fetching [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]]. Women were prominent in home-based crafts, and men might be involved in both farming tasks and crafts. Child rearing was spread among adult men and women and older siblings. Family, work, and workplace were closely integrated.
- [[Industrialisation|Industrialisation]] changed family dynamics
- Instead of everyone working, men went to factories or offices, some women went to the textile factory to work
	- Some stayed home to take care of children
- The caused gender roles to become more & more prominent
# New Experiences of Space and Time
- Peoples sense of time no longer depended on the seasons and such, but were rigid 24-hours or urban life
- Roads & better transportation allowed for someone's sense of reach to expand
# International Competition for Resources
>As [[Industrialisation]] diffused into mainland Europe, [[North America]], and Japan, competition for reliable sources of raw materials increased. It also became clear that new markets were needed to absorb the vast quantities of mass-produced goods. Therefore, industrializing countries turned to colonialism and imperialism to find more [[natural resources]] and new markets.
- The US had lots of resources to use(Lumber, timer, coal, [[iron]]) but it was different for European countries & Japan, they had fewer resources and needed to expand
- Great Britain needed cotton to expand it's textile industry, but it's climate isn't good for the plants
	- India was the worlds largest producer of cotton, so Britain took it over, banned cotton importation, and formed a monopoly
- The Berlin conference(1884) allowed other European countries to do the same to Africa
	- Britain got Egypt & Sudan(cotton)
	- France got West Africa(cotton and veggie oils)
	- Belgium got Congo(rubber)
# International Competition for Markets
>Industrial capitalism requires a constantly expanding, reliable market in which to sell its manufactured goods. On its own, mass consumption, the purchase of large amounts of mass-produced goods by large numbers of people, is not enough.
- Sales drop off often after mass-producing → mass-consumption as people are satisfied
	- Consumers may return to the market after their shoes wear out
	- So profits drop
- Imperialism was so that European countries secure foreign markets for their mass-produced items
	- Which led to the [[international division of labor]]
		- When different countries work together in and interdependent web in the economy

# Economic Sectors
>Economic sectors are groupings of industries based on what is produced and the activities of the workforce.
## [[Primary Sector]]
- Industries that extract [[natural resources]](renewable & non-renewable)
	- Fishing
	- Hunting 
	- Farming 
	- Logging
	- Oil extraction
	- Quarrying
	- Mining
## [[Secondary Sector]]
- Processes raw material into usable items(factory workers)
	- Ore → Steel
	- Logs → Lumber
	- Fish → Canned
## [[Tertiary Sector]]
- Provides services to businesses and consumers, including delivery & transportation
	- Checkout Clerks
	- Lawyers
	- Professors/Teachers
## [[Quaternary Sector]]
- Industries that focus on collecting and using information, innovation & invention
	- Scientists & research
	- Computer Programmer & software development
## [[Quinary Sector|Quinary Sector]] 
- Highest level of management & information use in business, government, science, & education
	- Has a global impact
	- CEO's
	- Presidents
# Patterns of Economic Development
>The organization of economic sectors implies a hierarchy of economic development. 
- The most common type of sector in a country can tell you it's type of development
	- Mostly [[Primary Sector|Primary Sector]] = least developed, and so on and so forth
## National Economic Core Areas
>Patterns of geographically uneven development arose within national economies as [[Industrialisation]] progressed. The steelmaking industry provides a good illustration.
- Industrial regions have many zones
	- The Core is where manufacturing happens
	- The periphery are the natural resource sources
	- This happens because it gives industries advantages
		- Being close to coalfields as a steelmaking industry
- A Base Industry is an industry with a large economical importance compared to other who depend on it(steel is the base industry in this example)
	- The steel industry attracts other ones in the secondary & tertiary sector to the core area
		- Industries that provide steelmaking areas with supplies
		- Specialized services
	- Which then causes other industries that need steel to form nearby
		- Car Factory
	- Then the movement of people into the area causes more economic growth in housing, retail, infrastructure, schools, etc.
## Global Economic [[Core States]]
- The Core-Periphery model applies globally also
	- The British controlled the manufacturing of textiles (by restricting the diffusion of the technology), but couldn't get the raw material input (cotton) in it's borders
	- So it took over Egypt & India, payed workers very little to collect cotton, and managed to gain a monopoly over the cotton business
		- Became a [[Core States|Core State]] 
	- Ultimately, causing Egypt & India to become [[Periphery States|peripheral states]] 
		- Most of their workforce was in the [[Primary Sector|Primary Sector]] 
	- This can be applied to many places around the world, and it's effects show uneven development
- In the late 20th century(1950s → 2000), a new category of [[Nation-States|Nation-States]] came
	- [[Semi-Periphery States|Semi-Periphery States]] are made up of countries whose economy are similar to the core & periphery
	- These countries were former colonies, leaving the periphery stage, gaining a larger [[Secondary Sector|secondary]] & [[tertiary sector]]
		- [[Mexico]]
		- [[Brazil]]
		- [[India]]
![[Core-SemiPeriphery-Periphery Model.png]]

# Common Factors Influencing Manufacturing Location
>The uneven distribution of industrial manufacturing across the globe reflects the many factors that influence the location of manufacturing.
# Energy
- Every manufacturing process needs energy
	- Early aluminium plants used lots of electricity, so they were located near hydroelectric facilities (Niagara Falls)
## Materials
- Good access to materials is a necessity for industrial locations
	- I.e. break-of-bulk points
		- A place in which large amounts of unpackaged goods, is transferred from one transportation to another
	- If a manufacturer is at a break-of-bulk point, transfer costs are lowered as loading & unloading is expensive
## Labour
- Companies often locate in areas with low wages to reduce costs
	- They also move to places with low education & high unemployment 
- The American center for textile manufacturing moved from the northeastern states(high wage) to the low wage south
## Markets
- Manufacturing is located near their consumers so they can reduce transport costs to maximize profits
## Transportation
- Transportation access is the most important factor in determining a business' location
	- 1/3 of goods are shipped by air
- Shipping containers have allowed for greater efficiency in shipping as ships, trucks, & trains have been designed to hold them
	- 90% of non-bulk cargo is transported in containers

>- Containerization, the system of intermodal freight transport using shipping containers, is a simple technology that altered the logic of manufacturing location. It allowed firms to move manufacturing to [[peripheral]] economies, helping to give rise to the semi-periphery.
# Location Theory
>Usually, two or more potential manufacturing locations will have different sets of advantages and disadvantages. Business managers must weigh these differences carefully in order to make the best decision.
## [[Least-Cost Theory]]
>One of the earliest and best-known theories of manufacturing location is Alfred Weber’s least-cost theory. Weber, a German economist, based his theory on his real-life observations of early [[Industrialisation]] in [[Europe]]. He set out to create a general theory to explain the spatial patterns he saw.
- Weber created ab location triangle, it had two locations for materials sources and one market
- He concluded that manufacturing would be located at the least costing transportation spots
- Distance & Weight were his to key variables
- He then examined the weight of the inputs compared to the manufactured goods, and noticed that transportation costs was the key to location of manufacturing 
- After doing vice versa, he concluded that if the final product was heavier than the inputs, the factory would be closer to the market(bottling plants), and vice versa if the raw materials are heavier than the final product.
- Limiations include
	- It doesn't represent real-world situations
	- It assumes people have perfect knowledge  of all factors
	- And today transportation costs are less important compared to labor, etc.

# [[Rostow’s Stages of Economic Growth]]
>The concept of economic development has a relatively short history. It emerged after World War II over concern about low living standards in many world regions. Subsequently, scholars established theories to explain why certain countries have or have not developed.
- Rostow made one of the earliest and most influential models of economic development
- He assumed that every country will go through the same 5 stages
- His model faces criticism because it suggests that countries develop in isolation
	- Wrong because our world is interconnected and a primary sector country may supply to a secondary sector country
- It also assumes that there will be no obstacles from other countries
# [[Wallerstein’s World Systems Theory]]
> World systems theory regards world history as moving through a series of socioeconomic systems, culminating in the modern world system by about the year 1900. The modern world system is our current interdependent, capitalist world economy rooted in nation-state economies.
- The world systems theory is based on the Core-Periphery-Semi-Periphery model[^1]
	- Core countries industrialised first
		- Western Europe, [[North America]], [[Japan]]
		- Have the complex manufacturing systems, and highest levels of consumption
	- The periphery is made up of mainly agricultural and extraction based countries, with low consumption
	- The semi-periphery is the middle-ground, they mediate politically & economically between the core and periphery
- World systems theory suggests that countries don't go through a set of development stages, instead are incorporated into the world economy by imperialism & colonialism
	- causing unequal development patterns
- The world systems theory is based on the [[international division of labor|international division of labor]], where the periphery is mainly the primary sector
- Core is tertiary & above
- Semi-periphery is in-between
- It also acknowledges that countries can shift to any of these phases, forwards or backwards
- It also says that countries with high mass consumption exploited the cheap resourced in less-developed countries
	- They underdeveloped the world to maintain their position
- It's criticised because of it's [[global scale]] of analysis
	- Which doesn't detail the complexities at the regional & [[City Scale|local scale]]
# [[Dependency Theory]]
>World systems theory builds on earlier dependency theory, which emerged from economists’ observations of South American economies. Scholars had become disillusioned by the failures of the developing countries of [[South America]] to move out of poverty and transform into “modern,” developed economies. The theory was soon applied to other world regions that had similarly failed to grow economically.
- Dependency theory focuses on the core & periphery, it says that the reason why poverty isn't gone isn't because of periphery countries, it's because core countries exploit them by forcing the periphery to be dependent on them
	- [[Colonialism]] & [[Imperialism]]
- It focused on how the core used the periphery as a raw material supplier, inhibiting economic growth
- But now it focuses on the profits being made in periphery countries, saying it's being siphoned to core countries
- They propose for periphery countries to delink and remove trade relationships from the core
- It's been criticised for pay too little attentions to the social & cultural patterns in the periphery & core that may also explain uneven development
- Delinking is also hard to do because the economy now is extremely interdependent
# [[Commodity Dependence]]
>Commodity dependence occurs when commodities account for more than 60 percent of the value of a country’s total exports
- Poorer countries tend to rely on their exports to make money, which means commodity dependence is linked to underdevelopment
# Measures of Economic Growth
>To identify a country’s level of development, it is often helpful to measure the size of the country’s economy. Common measures include gross national product, gross domestic product, and gross national income.
# Gross National Product (GNP)
- GNP measures the total value of all goods & services made by a countrys residents, regardless of where it was made
- GNP does not count foreign residents or businesses
	- If I made money in [[Ghana]], it'd count for America
# Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- Measures the value of all goods and services in a country no matter the producers origin
	- If I made money in [[Ghana]] it'd count for it's GDP not GNP
- Better for gauging economic health

![[Global GDP.png]] ^5cdc70
# [[Gross National Income]] ([[Gross National Income|GNI]])
- Gross national income is used to measure total income of a country's residents & businesses, regardless of where it was earned, including money gotten from other countries
	- GNI is more accurate measure of economic health for countries that gain lots of foreign aid & investment (Developing Countries)
	- It's more accurate as it counts available income in a national economy which GDP fails to account 
## Refining Gross Economic Measures
- [[Module 55 - Theories and Measures of Development#^5cdc70|The map above]] shows the large gaps in GDP from country to country as all it shows is what countries produce more goods & services than other countries
	- [[Brazil]] has the 9th largest GDP in the world, yet the average Brazilian is not 9x richer than the average New Zealander
		- This is because [[New Zealand]] has only 2% of the population of [[Brazil|Brazil]] so they don't make us much goods & services
- [[GDP per capita]] is a country's GDP divided by its population
	- It shows how rich or poor the average citizen of said country is
		- [[New Zealand|New Zealand's]] [[GDP per capita ]] is $41,966 (2018), while [[Brazil|Brazil's]] was $8,920
![[GDP per Capita.png]]
>Another problem with GDP & GNP is that they don't account for differences in currency value from one country to the next
- That's why economists made the [[Purchasing Power Parity|purchasing power parity]]([[Purchasing Power Parity|PPP]]) theory
- [[Purchasing Power Parity|PPP]] measures how much a normal "basket of goods" costs locally
	>- It begins with a set of commonly bought items and then uses currency exchange rates to compare the price of the basket in different locations
- [[Switzerland]] has a higher [[GDP per capita|GDP per capita]] than [[Australia|Australia]], so we can assume its citizens are richer
	- If an average pair of women's shoes is $60 in [[Switzerland|Switzerland]] and $20 in [[Australia|Australia]], we can say Australians can buy 3 times more shoes compared to the Swiss
		- So they have a higher [[Purchasing Power Parity|PPP]] (more bang for their buck)
		- [[Purchasing Power Parity|PPP]] also implies that [[Australia|Australia]]'s citizens are richer than [[Switzerland|Switzerland]]'s
		- A limitation is that is simplifies complex national economies
# Measures of Social Development
>Without sufficient economic resources, societies are unable to provide for their citizens. Recognising the need to consider quality-of-life issues, development specialists have devised various measures of social development.
## [[Gender Inequality Index|Gender Inequality Index]] ([[Gender Inequality Index|GII]])
- The [[Gender Inequality Index|Gender Inequality Index]] is a measure of gender inequality based on reproductive health, empowerment, and labor-market participation
	- Reproductive health is measured by maternal mortality ratios & adolescent birth rates
	- Empowerment is based upon the percentage of government seats taken by women & the amount of females & males over 25 with secondary education
	- The labor-market participation is based on the amount of male & females over 25 in the workforce
- [[Gender Inequality Index|GII]] has revealed gender inequalities and has caused policy debates
- [[Gender Inequality Index|GII]] doesn't completely capture all of gender inequality
	- Empowerment only measures national government participation
		- It doesn't represent day to day people
	- Labor-market participation doesn't consider the quality of jobs of women vs. men
		- It also doesn't count for unpaid labor, which fall a lot on women (caregiving, housekeeping)
## [[Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] ([[Human Development Index|HDI]])
- The World Bank created the [[Human Development Index|HDI]] to measure non-economical aspects of human life
	- It combines [[Life Expectancy|Life Expectancy]], education levels, & GNI per capita ([[Purchasing Power Parity|PPP]])
- Two countries with the same GNI per capita may have different [[Human Development Index|HDI]]s
- Although it was very revolutionary in measuring development levels of countries around the world, it doesn't capture QoL factors such as feelings of security or sense of self
	- It also doesn't say much about poverty, inequalities between religions & ethnicities & genders
# Other Development Measures and Considerations
>National economies and societies are highly complex, and the meaning of development continues to evolve.
## Formal & Informal Economic Sectors
- The informal sector is the part of an economy not officially recorded or taxed by the government
	- Babysitting, Yard Work, etc.
- Some countries have large informal sectors almost as big as the formal sector
	- It gains its workforce from people with little education/formal training
		- Women make up most of the sector as women are often discriminated in the formal sector
- Because its not recorded its not included in [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], GNP, or GNI
	- A country's economic activity may be underestimated
	- Since it isn't taxed the government doesn't get money to build [[infrastructure|infrastructure]] 
## Income Distribution
>However, per capita measures do not reveal income distribution. Income distribution refers to how a country’s total GDP is distributed among the individuals in its population. This is one way to assess economic inequality within countries.
## Access to Health Care
- Its hard to measure how people fell about their lives and their opportunities for self fulfilment
	- These depend on culture & history and are different for every person
- Healthcare can be used as a measure of well-being
	- It can include reproductive, maternal, newborn, child health, rate of disease
		- Reproductive health includes fertility rates
		- Newborn health measures [[infant mortality rate]]
	- Access to healthcare is measured by affordability & availability
## Fossil Fuel Use and Renewable Energy
- Measuring development can be done through the link between economic growth and energy consumption
	- In [[the industrial revolution]] [[fossil fuels|fossil fuel]] use spiked as machines became more common
		- The first industrialized countries had the advantage of domestic resources & resources gained through [[Imperialism|Imperialism]]
		- ==Fossil Fuel use → Economic Growth==
	- Developing countries face different circumstances
		- Some don't have domestic [[fossil fuels|fossil fuels]], so they need to use their money to but them from other countries
			- Stifling economic development 
		- Developing countries that do have a domestic source of [[fossil fuels|fossil fuels]] are in a better position, but often have to pay other countries to help with extraction & refining
- [[fossil fuels|fossil fuels]] have been shown to cause higher greenhouse gases
- Its also been shown that renewable energy sources contribute to economic development
	- For countries who don't have domestic [[fossil fuels|fossil fuels]], renewable energy decreases the cost of importing fuel
	- Renewable energy also helps the economy of a country grow

# Family Life
>Economic development changes women’s roles in society in profound ways. From whether, when, and whom they marry to new freedom of movement to new education opportunities, women’s lives are deeply affected.
- Society has always favoured men over women for many cultural reasons, but as they develop, preferential treatment towards mean decreases and women become more equal with them
## Female Education
- Male children are favoured because parents think that the sons will gain more money, so they can help the family more
	- Families also invest more in males because more education = higher income
- Economic growth increases job opportunities for everyone, so families may reconsider their investment choices
- There is a close correlation between economic growth & girls' education rates
	- Better economy → Girls stay in school longer
	- Global secondary education rates for girls has been increasing in the 21st century
	- In developed countries females are enrolling in college more than men
## Delayed Marriage & Declining Fertility Rates
- Higher education for girls led to delayed marriage and lower rates of adolescent childbearing (busy with college)
	- Theres also a link between economic growth and declining fertility rates
- Economic growth has made girls' roles in families more like boys'
	- Education and post-education employment ([[formal sector]])is expected from girls now
	- And expectations to be wives and mothers has decreased because of economic growth
# Public Life
>We can identify a consistent pattern of spatially assigned gender roles. Women are primarily assigned to private, domestic spaces (the household scale), while men are primarily assigned to public spaces (the local, regional, and global scales).
- As economies progress, women's roles expand in society, giving them more access to more participation in public life
## Geographic Mobility
>Geographic mobility, one’s relative ability to move through space, is a key measure of individual liberty and privilege. Like many liberties and privileges, women and men experience geographic mobility unevenly. Economic development significantly increases women’s freedom to move about as they become more active in school, employment, and the public sphere.
- Women's higher education and formal workforce participation increased their geographical mobility
	- Especially due to the expansion of the service sector in the mid-20th century
- In [[China]] and [[Mexico|Mexico]] the manufacturing sector has given young women jobs in the electronics industry
- Electric appliances (dishwasher, washing machine, etc.) have allowed women to not have to do housework as much
## Empowerment and Political Participation
- Higher education rates = more civics participation for women
- A way to calculate women in civics is to figure out the percentage that hold a governmental seats
	- Because it's so simple it misses other forms of public/political engagement
- The [[United Nations|UN]] came up with the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] to solve siad problems, GEM also measures the percent of women in economic decision  making positions like admin, and the amount of women's shared income vs. men's
# Devaluing Women's Labor
- Although women are now more common in the workforce, many jobs are still split into "men's work" & "women's work"
	- "Women's work" pays less
	- "Women's work" includes unpaid home labor, such work pushes women to gain a job in the informal sector (more flexible) but labor & wages are lower compared the formal sector
	- Women also make up the agricultural workforce in the first stages of development 
	- Countries with a high GDP per capita have women working in professional jobs, vice versa for low GDP per capita
		- Medium GDP has the lowest female participation rates
# “Men’s Work” and “Women’s Work”
- In the 19th century working in the office was considered mens work, but now it's womens work
	- But in [[India|India]] it is still considered mens work
	- [[Gender]] Divisions in work are often done through law
- The first wave of [[the industrial revolution|the industrial revolution]] jobs was mens jobs
	- Women weren't seen as strong enough
- After WW2 women worked to replace the men in factories who got deployed
	- Manufacturing jobs in developing countries are still considered womens work
		- These jobs keep gender gaps as thw wage is low, and there is practically no job security 
- In the world's 500 largest companies only 5% are lead by women
# Wage Disparity
- By gender coding jobs, males often earn more money even if he females are working a male-coded job
	- Gender pay gap is uneven across the world, developing countries have a much larger pay gap compared to developed countries 
		- North Africa & The Middle East have the largest pay gaps
![[Gender Pay Gaps - World.png]]
# Microloans as Economic Development Strategy
- In developing countries, women don't have access to banks as much as men do, they also own less property so they aren't able to gain loans
	- They are the poorest of the poor
- Microloans are small loans given to people with low income to help them build a small business
	- They are as small as $150 and help women buy tools & supplies to start a business 
	- Muhammad Yunus was able to get the most successes in Bangladesh
# The Limits of Microloans
- Although [[microloans]] are extremely helpful, some people fail to start a business and sink further into debt

# Explaining International Trade
>For half a millennium, geographers and economists have tried to answer the question “Why do countries trade with one another?” As the world has changed, so have the explanations for trade.
- In the 16th century (1500-1600) countries traded because of [[mercantilism]]
	- This means they tried to export more than they imported to gain money
	- [[Colonialism|Colonialism]] was a major part of the mercantilist system in [[Europe]], and formed a [[monopoly]] to their colonies
	- [[Protectionism]] are trade rules that restrict imports to protect domestic industries & jobs
		- Also a major part of [[mercantilism|mercantilism]]
- ![[Venice Mercantilism.png]] Venice was also a major mercantilist trade centre
- Adam Smith argued that the reason why countries trade is because of [[absolute advantage]]
	- Which is a country's ability to make a good or service more efficiently than another
	- Hr argued against [[protectionism]] because he believed in free movement of trade, and that the market would direct the flow based on [[absolute advantage|absolute advantage]]  
- David Ricardo argued [[absolute advantage|absolute advantage]] would mean the trade would be very unequal, so he proposed that trade happens because of [[comparative advantage]]
	- This is when a country is able to produce one product more efficiently than other products in its [[economy]]
	- Countries will specialise in industries in which it has a [[comparative advantage|comparative advantage]] and export them, while importing the non-[[comparative advantage|comparative advantage]] items
>- Complementarity is a measure of how well one country’s export profile matches another country’s import profile. A high degree of complementarity can provide the basis for successful trade.
- Some people recognise the rise of [[Transnational Corporation|transnational corporations]]
	- A [[Transnational Corporation|TNC]] is a firm with the power to coordinate and control operations in more than one country, even if it does not own those operations
		- [[Competitive advantage]] is a firms ability to outperform other [[Transnational Corporation|TNC]]s in the industry
		- They work to keep a [[competitive advantage]] by upgrading
# Emerging Patterns of Global Trade 
- International trade has increased importance to the world economy because of [[globalisation]]
	- The world GDP growth matched with the increase in world trade volume
- Through history international trade meant between countries but today, it's mostly [[Transnational Corporation|TNCs]] doing the trading
	- TNCs account for 2/3 of world exports
	- Most TNC trade happens inside the TNC not different ones as a TNC has multiple firms around the world
- Growth in global trade is also uneven
	- 10 countries make up over 50% of total world trade 
		- [[China]] leads the trade of goods
		- While the [[United States of America|US]] leads trade of commercial services
	- [[Asia]] has had the highest export growth, while Africa decreased
# Trade Organisations
- [[Protectionism|Protectionism]] has reduced the flow of exports & imports in history
- So some countries work together to reduce the trade barriers made
	- [[Neoliberalism]] has displaced [[protectionism]] as an economic strategy
		- [[Neoliberalism|Neoliberalism]] holds a large rand of pro-market & anti-government positions`
			- Reducing government ownership & regulation
			- Promoting privatisation
			- Market-based solutions
		- New international trade organizations have been made based on the shift to [[neoliberalism]]
			- The [[United Nations|UN]] is a prime example, it started the [[International Monetary Fund]] & the World Bank
				- The [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]] seeks global monetary cooperation, financial stability, and sustainable economic growth
				- It provides loans to countries that are extremely deep in debt
				- And provides funding for developing countries
			- The [[United Nations|UN]] also established the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
				- An agreement to bring down trade barriers (tariffs)
# Regional Trade Agreements
>In addition to the global-scale efforts of the IMF, World Bank, and WTO, there have been numerous other initiatives at regional scales. These take various forms, such as free-trade agreements and customs unions.
## Free-Trade Agreements
>A free-trade agreement is a treaty between two or more countries that reduces tariffs and promotes foreign investment. Tariffs are taxes (sometimes called duties) on imported goods and services. The tariff is a percentage of the total cost of the product, including shipping, thus raising the price of the imported product.
- The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) eliminates some tariffs and trade barriers between the three countries & increased international trade volume between them (unevenly)
- The EU however has no tariffs and barriers
## [[Customs Union|Customs Unions]]
- A [[customs union]] is a free-trade agreement between member countries, with an external trade policy for nonmembers
	- EUCU
	- Mercosur
	- A bloc of countries can remove tariffs in the union, but still enforce them for nonmembers
## Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
- A trade agreement to regulate oil output, founded in 1965 by [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Venezuela]] to coordinate oil production and avoid trade competition with memebers
	- OPEC controls 44% of the worlds oil & influences global oil supply and prices
# Government Initiatives
- Tariffs are targeted at specific countries an exports
	- Retaliation can start tariff wars in which trade and economic growth is slowed extremely in both countries
- Embargos are bans on trade with a country or product
# The Importance of Financial Markets
>The world economy is now so interconnected that most consumer purchases are dependent on activities occurring in multiple countries. Let’s explore how this level of interdependence developed and what it means for economic development.
- Computers and new technology allow for near-instantaneous trade of financial products (stocks), investors can buy & sell stocks in response to the economic conditions quickly, this has speed up global trade
- Financial markets are where stocks & other financial goods are traded (New York Stock Exchange)
## International Financial Crises
>The world economy has experienced a series of financial crises that negatively affected virtually every country in the world. Each crisis demonstrated how financial markets have made the world increasingly interconnected and its countries interdependent.
## 1980s Latin American Debt Crisis
- OPEC had an embargo in 1973 that brought oil prices up 400%
	- OPEC countries got lots of money and invested their cash into international banks
	- The flood of money into the banks caused a global money surplus which lowered international credit
- Latin American countries took advantage and borrowed lots of money for [[Industrialisation|Industrialisation]]
	- Their debt went up much higher than their GDP growth
- This caused a debt crisis
	- Banks cut off credit to Latin America, and the IMF was forced to intervene and help
## Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2008
>The growing importance of financial markets has created incentives for bankers to develop new, often risky, financial products. If these financial products lose money, the effects on the world economy can be devastating, as in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008.
- Banks started offering more mortgages in the late 1990s to people with little financial resources
	- They were risky as it wasn't the borrowers' income being used to pay
- Banks put all the loans they gave out and used it as a product that will earn investors more money when it was paid back
	- So they bought them
- This caused a large amount of homebuyers which brought up the price of homes, then in 2006 house prices plunged
	- Mortgage holders now owed more than the worth of the houses
	- People started now paying loans, causing the value of the debt products to collapse
- Investment banks almost failed until the government spammed money to fix it
- The crisis caused mass unemployment & bankruptcies around the world
# Economic Development
>The rising importance of financial markets in the world economy has reinforced patterns of geographically uneven development. A small number of cities, mostly in developed countries, now control most international financial transactions. These cities include [[New York]], [[London]], [[Chicago]], [[Zurich]], [[Tokyo]], and [[San Francisco]]. However, [[Asia]] is emerging as an important player in the financial sector, and Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore are among the top nine cities that together control about three-quarters of the world’s financial transactions.
- Global financial crises affect developing and developed countries differently
	- The Latin American debt crisis lead to a change in development strategy
		- They were trying to do [[Import substitution industrialisation]]
			- Which is a policy that tries to replaced imported goods with domestic goods and reduce dependence
		- They had to turn to the IMF for help and they demanded them to leave behind [[Import substitution industrialisation|Import substitution industrialisation]]

# Deindustrialisation in the Core
>In the years following World War II, the United States was by far the world’s manufacturing leader. Then, in the early 1970s, a significant restructuring of the world economy began, including deindustrialisation in the United States and other core regions.
## The Decline of Manufacturing Sector Employment
- After WW2 a period of growth called Fordism occurred
	- It refers to the economic & social arrangement based on mass production, high amounts of people in labor unions, stable/full-time manufacturing employment, and wages that allow mass consumption
	- It's named after Henry Ford, who utilised assembly lines to mass produce cars
		- He also brought higher standards of living
		- And expanded the middle class
- In 1970s industrial [[infrastructure|infrastructure]] became outdated
	- Costs of business increased in old manufacturing centres
	- Land value, wages, and taxes were high
	- Old transportation [[infrastructure|infrastructure]] caused congestion
- Because of this, [[corporate disinvestment]] became a widespread happenstance
	>- [[Corporate disinvestment]] is a process in which companies stop investing in factory construction, equipment, and improvement and begin selling off assets, such as machinery, buildings, and land.
	- ==As disinvestment happened companies shifted investment into manufacturing in the periphery & semi-periphery==
- Relocation of manufacturing and support services from one country to another is known as [[offshoring]].
	- [[Offshoring]] reduces costs because wages are lower in the periphery
- [[Outsourcing]] is when a firm gives part of its internal operations to a third party
	- A computer company might sell its touchscreen factory to another company and then buy screens from them
	- Or remove its accounting department and have it outsourced instead
- All of these factors led to [[deindustrialisation]] and a movement away from [[fordism]]
	- In 1950 [[deindustrialisation|deindustrialisation]] caused the percentage of employment in the manufacturing sector to go from 32% to 8.4% in 2020
		- ==This was due to improvements in productivity not a decrease in output==
	- [[Deindustrialisation]] ruined many manufacturing regions like [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], and [[Pennsylvania]]
		- As base industries left, the supporting industries had to shut down
## The Rise of Service Sector Employment
- As manufacturing sector jobs decreased, the service industry boomed(including the [[tertiary sector|tertiary sector]], [[Quaternary Sector|quaternary sector]], and [[quinary sector]])\
	- By 2020 the service sector grew to 71.2% of all private sector employment
	- The service sector makes up the largest share of GDP in core regions
		- In the United States, the service sector is 4 times as large, GDP wise
# [[Industrialisation|Industrialisation]] in the [[Periphery States|Periphery]]
>The effects of restructuring on the periphery and semi-periphery are nearly mirror images of the effects in the core. The shift of manufacturing from the core to the periphery and semi-periphery has profoundly reshaped the geography of [[Industrialisation]], creating a new international division of labor in the process.
## [[Special Economic Zone]](s)
- Since the 1970s developing countries have attracted foreign investors & boosting [[Industrialisation]] by making [[Special Economic Zone|special economic zones]]
	- An [[Special Economic Zone|SEZ]] is an area in a country in which business & trade laws are different from the rest of the country
		- In an [[Special Economic Zone|SEZ]] the government might lower taxes, or help [[Transnational Corporation|TNCs]] set up a factory
		- The number of [[Special Economic Zone|SEZs]] has spiked
			- In 1975 only 29 countries had them, in 2019 147 countries had them ==(especially developing countries)==
	- The most important type of SEZs are [[export processing zones]] & [[free-trade zones]]
		- EPZs are zones with incentives to attract investment to places where materials undergo processing or assembly before being exported
			- Goods shipped from an EPZ don't have tariffs or other taxes
			- TNCs invest in EPZs(in developing countries) because production costs are lower than the core
				- Low wages in the periphery
				- Labor unions are rare in EPZs too, allowing companies to exploit workers
		- FTZs are designated duty-free zones for providing warehousing, storage, and distribution facilities for trade & export
			- They are located where international trade is focused
				- Seaports
				- Airports
				- Border Crossings
## Global-Scale Production Systems
- The rapid increase in number of SEZs, EPZs, and FTZs is because of the interconnected global economy
	- SEZs, EPZs, & FTZs are a result of firms being in competition that caused governments to attract them for foreign investment
	- They are also the cause of our interconnected world due to all the foreign investments and such
- There are 5000 FTZs in 147 countries which forms a system in which goods move across borders without duties
	- Duties aren't paid until the product is complete, which keeps prices to consumers low
- EPZs have restructured the world economy as employment in the core has shifted from secondary to tertiary & quaternary, and primary to secondary & tertiary in semi-periphery countries
- In 1980 [[China|China]] made its first SEZs, most of them were EPZ seaport cities
	- The low wages, closeness to the worlds largest market, investment, & environment of the EPZs made them perfect for investors and they flooded into
	- They allowed for China to transform into a manufacturing economy and fuelled 30 years of economic growth 
		- By 2020 China accounted for 2/3 of the worlds EPZ employment
- Chinas shift to manufacturing and other developing countries as shown the new [[international division of labor|international division of labor]], which is the global enlarging of manufacturing, [[Transnational Corporation|Transnational Corporation]]s have also influenced global manufacturing operations, by focusing in the low-wage countries, which also increased labor-intensive manufacturing 
- This allowed China to become the worlds manufacturing leader, and now the largest GDP
# Post-Fordism
- Post-Fordism is the shift on manufacturing centres to dispersed production sites
	- Mass Production → Batch Production
	- Permanent Workforce → Temporary Employee & Contract Workers
		- Flexibility
>Just-in-time-manufacturing (JIT) is the production of small batches of goods as needed by customer demand. JIT manufacturing (also called JIT delivery) reduces warehousing costs while shortening delivery times between suppliers and manufactures. It also decreases a company’s dependence on a large, permanent factory workforce in favor of temporary employees and contract workers. That is, the company can flexibly expand the workforce during peak-demand periods, then reduce the workforce in low-demand periods.
- In Post-Fordism the importance of economies of scale decreases(when the cost per-unit decreases as outputs increase)
- Cost reductions are done through JIT production, which removes the need for managing inventory
# The Role of High-Technology Industries
- A high-tech industry uses advanced tech and has the highest R&D
	- They are made up off computers, communications and electronics, and pharmaceuticals
		- They have lots of money investment
		- And use the tech in production
			- All Quaternary industries, that need highly educated, skilled workforce
- Oil & Gas dominated the top 10 most valued companies in 1980, in 2020 they all disappeared and were replaced by high-tech companies
- It also shows how much the world economy has grown under Post-Fordism
	- All of 1980s top 10 doesn't event make 1/4 of the current #1
	- China is also up there
>Agglomeration economies occur where firms cluster spatially in order to take advantage of geographic concentrations of skilled labor and industry suppliers, specialized infrastructure, and ease of face-to-face contact with industry participants. They are most commonly found in or near large metropolitan areas.
- Agglomeration economies seem to go against the whole spatially dispersed part of post-Fordism
	- Clustering reducing costs, and increases interaction
	- Silicon Valley includes world class universities, 3 international airports, and 5 tech HQs
		- Almost nothing is actually manufactured there, most things are R&D
	- Multiplier effects may occur(one industry indirectly creating more & more) in San Fran Bay its estimated that per 1 job generated by the high-tech sector, 4.3 are made in other fields helping grow the area
>Growth poles are geographically pinpointed centers of economic activity organized around a designated industry, commonly in the high-tech sector.
- They usually fail if are too small or too many
	- Work best when investment is concentrated in one area that can grow

- Sustainable development aims to meet present consumption needs without jeopardizing future generations' ability to meet theirs.
- [[Industrialisation]] consumes [[natural resources]], leading to depletion and contamination of air and [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]].
## Resource Depletion
- Resource depletion includes both renewable and nonrenewable resources.
- Common forms of resource depletion: mining, deforestation, soil erosion, aquifer depletion, overfishing.
- Industrial manufacturing primarily relies on nonrenewable resources.
- Industrial agriculture contributes to resource depletion, particularly through water usage and deforestation.
- The rapid depletion of resources questions the [[sustainability]] of current mass-consumption habits globally.
## Environmental Pollution
- Environmental pollution negatively impacts the physical and biological components of the environment.
- Pollution sources categorized into point sources (e.g., factories) and nonpoint sources (e.g., runoff).
- Factories release various chemicals into the atmosphere and water bodies, posing risks to human and aquatic life.
- Nonpoint sources of pollution include runoff from agriculture, mining, and urban areas.
## Climate Change Effects
- Climate change involves long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns.
- Human activities, notably [[Industrialisation]], have significantly contributed to climate change.
- CO2 emissions from combustion, particularly from fossil fuels, are a primary human-generated source of atmospheric CO2.
- [[Industrialisation]] has led to a dramatic increase in atmospheric CO2 levels, causing a rise in global temperatures.
- Climate change effects include rising sea levels, coastal flooding, stronger hurricanes, prolonged droughts, and more severe heat waves.

## **Conserving [[Natural Resources]]**
  - Following the 4 R's: reduce, reuse, recycle, and rethink to slow resource depletion.
  - Techniques for reducing resource consumption include using efficient methods in industrial agriculture and conserving energy in consumer activities.
  - Reusing and recycling resources, such as establishing cogeneration facilities and utilizing recycled materials.
  - Rethinking approaches to achieve environmentally sustainable and socially just economic development.
  
## Reducing Pollution
  - Government regulations, like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act in the United States, significantly reduced industrial pollution.
  - Standards set for emissions and wastewater reduced toxic contaminants in the air and [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]].
  - Despite successes in developed countries, some rapidly developing nations lack adequate pollution laws, leading to severe air and water pollution in cities like Beijing, Jakarta, and New Delhi.
## Carbon-Neutral [[Industrialisation]]
  - Aim for carbon neutrality through emissions reduction and carbon removal efforts.
  - Many countries, including France, New Zealand, and Norway, aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
  - Carbon removal methods include carbon offsets, such as forest conservation and reforestation projects.
  - Emissions reductions involve transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like hydroelectric, solar, and wind power.
# Introduction to Ecotourism
  - Proposal of ecotourism as an economic development strategy for developing countries.
  - Definition: Ecotourism is travel to natural areas supporting conservation efforts and socially just economic development.
  - Sustainable management of lodging and facilities using renewable energy, waste recycling, and water conservation.
## Economic Aspect of Ecotourism
  - Natural landscapes like forests and marine ecosystems can bring sustained economic growth if protected.
  - Revenue from ecotourism directly contributes to local conservation efforts.
## Social Component of Ecotourism
  - Emphasizes cultural and environmental education for both tourists and local residents.
  - Tourists gain a deeper understanding of the destination's people, place, and environment.
  - Creation of new jobs empowers local residents as guides and hosts.
  - Significant portion of ecotourism revenue should benefit the local community.
## Chumbe Island Coral Park
  - Example of a successful ecotourism destination in Tanzania.
  - Attractions include protected coral reef, tropical forest, and rare wildlife.
  - Sustainable lodging with locally sourced materials, composting toilets, and solar-powered lighting.
  - Support for local community through purchasing supplies from local farmers and artisans.
  - Provision of environmental education and community outreach programs.
## Ecotourism as an Economic Development Alternative
  - Tourism based on natural landscapes for economic development.
  - Ecotourism: Defined as travel to natural areas in support of conservation and socially just economic development.
  - [[Sustainability]] Practices: Lodging and facilities designed and managed sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, waste recycling, and water conservation.
  - Economic Logic: Protecting natural landscapes can bring sustained economic growth; revenue from ecotourism supports local conservation efforts.
  - Social Component: Cultural and environmental education aspects for tourists; creation of local jobs and empowerment of residents as guides and hosts.
  - Example: Chumbe Island Coral Park in Tanzania showcases successful ecotourism practices.
## The Limits of Ecotourism
  - Profit Distribution: Large international corporations dominate the tourism industry, taking the majority of profits; limited contribution to destination countries' GDP.
  - Job Nature: Majority of jobs created are low-skilled and low-wage.
  - Environmental Impact:
    - [[City Scale|Local Scale]]: Positive effect on wildlife and landscape preservation, but lodging may have negative environmental impacts.
    - [[Regional Scale]]: Transportation infrastructure can have negative environmental impacts similar to fossil fuel-based transportation systems.
    - [[Global Scale]]: Reliance on passenger jets contributes to global warming.
# [[United Nations|UN]] Sustainable Development Goals
- Establishment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the [[United Nations]] in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
- Transition towards a holistic approach considering human well-being and environmental [[sustainability]].
- 17 SDGs aimed at ending poverty, protecting the environment, and achieving prosperity for all countries by 2030.
- Reflects a shift from purely economic understanding of development.
## Measuring Progress
- Principal means for evaluating and comparing countries' development status.
- High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) monitors progress.
- Sustainable Development Report provides annual review of 193 [[United Nations|UN]] member states' performances on SDGs.
- Data collection involves complex methods and relies on voluntary cooperation.
- Examples of indicators for SDG 11, "Sustainable Cities and Communities," demonstrate the complexity of measurements involved.
- Comprehensive assessment provides a single score ranging from 0 to 100 for each country.
- Denmark ranked highest in 2019 report with a score of 85, while the Central African Republic ranked lowest with a score of 39.
- Challenges highlighted in the 2019 report include income inequalities, health and education gaps, climate change, and biodiversity conservation.
- Encouraging signs observed in renewable resource power generation and ecotourism contributing to sustainable development.
- Global monitoring and assessment crucial for keeping countries focused on SDGs.
