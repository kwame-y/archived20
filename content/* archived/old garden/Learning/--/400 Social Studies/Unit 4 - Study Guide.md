>Describe the world political map and what we can learn from it.
>
>Define the different types of political entities.
# Independent [[State|States]] and Sovereignty
- **Most modern states are independent, ruling themselves** without the authority of another state.
- Exceptions exist, such as **Greenland (owned by Denmark) and unincorporated territories like Guam and Puerto Rico.**
- Some territories, like the British Virgin Islands, have self-governance while maintaining ties with a larger political entity.
- Independent states possess sovereignty, the right to control political and economic affairs within their boundaries without external interference.
- International law acknowledges states' boundaries, their right to exist independently, and their authority to govern.
## [[Nation|Nations]], [[Nation-States]], and Nationalism
- **Nation:** A community with a common identity based on shared cultural traits (language, [[Ethnicity]], religion) and bound to a homeland.
- Examples include Native American nations, the Cornish people in the UK, and the Sami in Finland.
- **Nation-State:** An ideal political unit where the nation's boundaries match the state's territorial boundaries.
- Few contemporary states fit this ideal due to globalisation, but examples include Iceland, Finland, and the Koreas.
- **Nationalism:** A sense of collective identity and belonging to a national culture, often marked by state boundaries.
- Strong nationalism can lead to efforts to preserve cultural similarity, including restricting [[Immigration]].
## Stateless Nations
- Some ethnic groups, like the Kurds, are divided by international boundaries and lack their own state.
- Stateless nations, like the Kurds, face challenges in seeking independence through political and military means.
## Multinational States, Colonialism, and Multistate Nations
- **Most countries today are multinational states**, containing multiple national, ethnic, and religious groups.
- Examples include **South Africa**, with its diverse languages, and the former Yugoslavia, which collapsed due to ethnic divisions.
- **Colonialism has left many contemporary states in Africa, [[Asia#South Asia|South Asia]], and Southeast Asia ethnically and linguistically diverse.**
- Multistate nations, like the Yoruba in [[Africa#West Africa|West Africa]], have populations divided among multiple states.
# Autonomous and Semiautonomous Regions
- **[[Autonomous Region]]:** A section or territory with a degree of self-government (e.g., Native American reservations in the United States).
- **Semiautonomous Region:** Has some degree of self-government but not complete autonomy.
- Examples include Catalonia in Spain, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, and Greenland as a semiautonomous Danish territory.
- Regions in western [[Europe]], such as Corsica (France) and Flanders/Wallonia (Belgium), seek autonomy or self-rule.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- What is the difference between a [[Nation|Nation]]  and a [[Nation-State|Nation-State]] 
>A [[Nation|Nation]] is a group of people shared cultural and historical ties, while a [[Nation-State|Nation-State]] is a state which borders match up with its [[Nation|Nation]] 

>[!faq]- What is an [[Autonomous Region]]
>An [[Autonomous Region]] is a self-governing area with a level of independence from the central government.

>[!tip]- Learning Goals
>Identify the concepts that shape the political geography of today’s world.
>
>Explain the processes that influence political boundaries.
# Introduction
- The contemporary world map, displaying political boundaries of about 200 countries, is the result of centuries-long processes explored in this module.
- Examines historical and present processes shaping national boundaries.
# Sovereignty and Self-Determination
- **Self-Determination:** A nation's ability to determine its statehood, allegiances, and government.
- Historical roots in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, tied to the right of culturally distinct groups to govern themselves.
- Examples include the American Revolution and the fragmentation of Russia after World War I.
- Enshrined in the [[United Nations]] charter in 1945, influencing independence movements in Africa, [[South America]], and Southeast Asia.
- The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 resulted in the creation of 15 sovereign nation-states.
## Core Areas
- Some states expanded from core areas, geographic centers of power.
- Historical power centers formed around attractive resources and geographic features, growing outward with the support of major cities.
- Core areas remain crucial in countries that diffused from a core, unlike those created to fill a political void.
- Examples include France, China, and the United States.
- Countries without a political core, like Belgium and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, face challenges to national identity.
## The Physical Environment
- Political phenomena and spatial variations often linked to terrain, soils, climate, and [[natural resources]].
- Natural protection, like mountains or coastlines, historically aided a country's survival.
- Territorial growth justified by doctrines like Manifest Destiny (U.S.) or the belief in Euro-American privilege (Russia).
# Sovereignty and Globalization
- Globalization, driven by the Internet, satellite communications, and free trade agreements, challenges nation-state sovereignty.
- Some argue that states' power diminishes as globalisation operates beyond international borders.
- Geographer John Agnew introduces the concept of effective sovereignty, where a state's power extends beyond its territory.
- Example: The U.S. exercises effective sovereignty over Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, despite being outside U.S. territory.
## Independence Movements
### Africa
- Colonialism's demise influenced by educated Africans exposed to Western political philosophy.
- Spread of political independence in Africa in the mid-20th century, overcoming hurdles like Portuguese resistance.
- Independence movements in Algeria, Zimbabwe, and [[Africa#South Africa|South Africa]] marked by conflicts and delays.
### [[South America]]
- Independence movements in [[South America]] mirrored events leading to the Revolutionary War in the United States.
- Spanish and Portuguese elites frustrated with orders from [[Europe]] led to wars for independence.
- Formation of South American countries during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
### Modern [[Europe]]
- Nationalist movements in [[Europe]], like Catalonia in Spain and Scotland in the UK, challenge state sovereignty.
- [[Devolution]] explored as a movement of power from central to regional governments within a state.
## [[Devolution]]
### Ethnocultural Forces and Ethnonationalism
- [[Devolution]] driven by forces like [[Ethnicity]], language, and religion.
- Ethnonationalism supports political interests of ethnic groups seeking independence or self-determination.
- Examples include Czechoslovakia's peaceful division and conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
### Economic Forces
- Economic factors contribute to [[devolution]], as seen in Catalonia's desire for fiscal independence from Spain.
- Examples in Sardinia, Italy, and the Republic of the Pampas in Brazil.
### Territorial Forces
- [[Devolution]] often occurs on state margins or islands, strengthened by distance from the capital.
- Examples include the United Kingdom's devolved regions, the Basques in Spain and France, and Puerto Rico's quasi-state status.
- Debate exists within separatist groups on achieving sovereignty, sometimes leading to terrorism or armed conflicts.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- What is sovereignty
>Sovereignty is the authority of a state to govern itself and make decisions within its own borders.

>[!faq]- What is globalisation
>Globalization is the increasing connectedness and interdependence of economies, cultures, and societies on a global scale.

>[!tip]- Learning Goals
>Identify the concepts geographers use to describe political power.
>
Describe territoriality in political geography.
# Neocolonialism
- Colonialism allowed European countries to control overseas territories through direct rule, displacing native rulers.
- Neocolonialism, a modern form of political power, involves indirect domination of peripheral states by [[core states]].
- [[Core states]] (wealthy and powerful) exploit peripheral states (less wealthy) economically and politically, maintaining dependence.
- Examples in Africa and Latin America illustrate how former colonial rulers influence economies and hinder development.
## Neocolonialism in Africa:
- Dependence on a single cash crop (Cocoa), controlled by former colonizers, leads to economic vulnerability.
- Foreign aid often takes the form of high-interest loans, perpetuating poverty and hindering economic development.
## Neocolonialism in Latin America:
- Historical exploitation by foreign powers affected economies negatively.
- Paraguay resisted neocolonialism but faced conflict and economic collapse.
- Global farming businesses in developing countries contribute to neocolonial relationships.
# Shatterbelts
- Regions with persistent fragmentation due to [[Module 26 - Political Processes#Devolution|devolution]], acting as buffer zones between hostile states.
- High religious, linguistic, and ethnic diversity, often containing important resources.
- Examples in East Central Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
## The Eastern Europe Shatterbelt:
- Historical conflicts in the Balkan Peninsula due to cultural differences, foreign rule, and communist regimes.
- Tensions persist among new countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, leading to regional instability.
# [[Choke Points]]
- Narrow features restricting passage to another [[Region]], important in maritime trade.
- Strategic [[Choke Points]] include the Strait of Hormuz, Strait of Malacca, and Suez Canal.
## Strategic [[Choke Points]]:
- Strait of Hormuz: Vital for Persian Gulf oil exporters, potential for disruptions impacting global oil supply.
- Strait of Malacca: Shortest sea route for Persian Gulf oil to Asian markets, susceptible to blockades and piracy.
- Suez Canal: Connects Red Sea and Mediterranean, crucial for maritime trade, historical significance.
# Territoriality in Political Geography
- A political and cultural strategy claiming power over land, people, and resources.
- Boundaries, both international and internal, define territories and manage conflict.
- Enclaves, exclaves, and challenging territorial configurations affect governance.
## Geographic Variation in [[Nation-State]] Territories:
- World regions exhibit varying degrees of political fragmentation.
- Enclaves and exclaves, like Lesotho and Kaliningrad, pose governance challenges.
- Country shapes and configurations can impact stability and ease of control, but geography alone doesn't determine governance outcomes.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- What is a choke point
>A choke point is a narrow feature restricting passage to another [[Region]],

>[!faq]- What is territoriality in political geography
>Territoriality in political geography refers to how a government or group exercises control over a specific geographic area. Through borders.

>
>**Describe** the characteristics of special boundaries.
>
>**Explain** how boundaries influence identities and interactions between governments.
>
>**Explain** how the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] affects international relations.
# Types of Country Boundaries
- **Delimitation and Demarcation**: The process involves both delimitation, the identification of limits, and demarcation, the physical separation of those limits. The median line principle is an illustration, notably visible in the Delaware River.
## Relic Boundaries
- **Definition**: Relic boundaries, though obsolete as international borders, endure as cultural imprints in the landscape.
- **Examples**:
    - *Hadrian’s Wall*: Constructed in 122 CE to fortify the Roman Empire, it now stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with remnants and hiking paths.
    - *Berlin Wall*: Erected post-World War II, it symbolized the division of East and West Germany until its dismantling in 1989.
## [[Superimposed Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Imposed without regard to existing cultural boundaries, often exacerbating conflicts.
- **Example**: Belgium's imposition of boundaries on Rwanda and Burundi during colonialism, illustrating the disregard for pre-existing cultural divisions.
## [[Subsequent Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Evolving with the [[Cultural Landscape]], set as groups settle in new territories.
- **Examples**:
    - *China-Vietnam Border*: Negotiated post-Lý–Song War, demarcated by rivers, formalized in the Treaty of Tientsin (1885).
    - *US-Canada Border*: Established through treaties like the Webster–Ashburton Treaty (1842), solidifying boundaries from Maine to Minnesota.
## [[Antecedent Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Identified before area settlement.
- **Examples**:
    - *49th Parallel*: Delimited in 1846 between the US and Canada.
    - *Malaysia-Indonesia Border on Borneo*: Outlined during the colonial period, defined by the Anglo–Dutch Treaty of 1891.
## [[Geometric Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Regular, often straight lines irrespective of physical or cultural features.
- **Examples**:
    - *US-Canada Border West of Lake of the Woods*: An example of a geometric boundary.
    - *African Colonial Boundaries*: Often superimposed geometric lines, a consequence of colonial powers' division during decolonization.
## [[Consequent Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Formed to accommodate existing cultural differences.
- **Examples**:
    - *China-Vietnam Border*: Also serving as a consequent boundary between two distinct cultures.
    - *Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland Border*: Dividing along religious lines, primarily Protestant and Catholic.
## Demilitarized Zones
- **Definition**: Designated areas where treaties prohibit military activities.
- **Examples**:
    - *Korean Peninsula DMZ*: Fortified along latitude 38° N, it reflects historical geopolitical tensions.
    - *Idlib Demilitarization*: 2018 agreement between Turkey and Russia in Syria's Idlib [[Region]], emphasizing conflict resolution.
# Political Agreements
## Berlin Conference
- **Context**: Convened in 1884–1885 to regulate European colonization in Africa.
- **Outcomes**: Resulted in colonial partitioning, overshadowing existing African autonomy, and establishing enduring boundaries post-WWII.
# Buffer States
- **Definition**: Independent yet politically and economically weak countries strategically positioned between powerful states.
- **Example**: Thailand, an independent state serving as a buffer between British and French colonial empires in [[Asia]].
# Satellite States
- **Definition**: Nominally independent countries under the political, military, and economic control of a more powerful state.
- **Example**: Poland, transitioning into a Soviet satellite state post-WWII as part of the Eastern Bloc.
# The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] ([[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]])
- **Definition**: Established in 1982, [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]] defines territorial boundaries and rights to the sea.
- **Significance**: Introduced four zones, particularly the [[Exclusive Economic Zones|Exclusive Economic Zone]] ([[Exclusive Economic Zones|EEZ]]), altering geopolitical dynamics globally.
- **Example**: Spratly Islands dispute, highlighting the impact of [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]] on maritime claims.
# Global Warming and Rising Sea Levels
- **Impact on Boundaries**: Sea level rise (SLR) since the 1880s, accelerating, leading to changes in territorial boundaries, loss of access to fisheries, and potential international disputes.
- **Example**: Implications in the Arctic Circle, where melting ice opens new shipping routes.
- **Note**: Findings of international tribunals may not represent final outcomes in disputes.
# Key Questions 
>[!faq]- What are the different types of country boundaries?
>Relic, Antecedent, Geometric, Superimposed, Consequent/Subsequent 

>[!faq]- What is an [[Exclusive Economic Zones|EEZ]]
>An [[Exclusive Economic Zones|Exclusive Economic Zone]] ([[Exclusive Economic Zones|EEZ]]) is an area of the sea prescribed by [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]] in which a country has special rights regarding the use of marine resources within 200 nautical miles of it’s shoreline

# Voting Districts and Electoral Geography

## Voting Districts
- **Definition**: Territories designated for organizing voting, influencing election outcomes at various levels.
- **Example**: Purple Sage, Wyoming, serves as a microcosm, showcasing how a single voting district can influence local and national representation.
## Electoral College
- **Function**: The unique method employed in the U.S. for selecting the president, with 538 electors from states determining the outcome.
- **Impact**: Enables states with varying populations to have proportional influence, contributing to the complexity of presidential elections.
- **Challenge**: Instances like the 2000 and 2016 elections, where candidates won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College, highlight its controversial nature.
# Reapportionment and Redistricting
## Congressional Reapportionment
- **Cycle**: Occurs every 10 years after the U.S. [[Census]] to adjust the distribution of House seats based on population changes.
- **Outcome**: Shifts in political power, illustrated by states gaining or losing seats based on population fluctuations.
## Redistricting
- **Definition**: Drawing new boundaries for congressional districts after reapportionment.
- **Objective**: Maintain balanced representation and adapt to demographic changes.
- **Challenge**: Susceptibility to manipulation, as evidenced by the historic role of [[gerrymandering]].
# [[Gerrymandering]]

## Definition and Methods
- **[[Gerrymandering]]**: Manipulating district boundaries to favor specific political parties or outcomes.
- **Methods**:
    - *Packing*: Concentrating opposition votes to create an artificially large majority.
    - *Cracking*: Dividing opposition votes across districts to dilute their impact.
## Gill v. Whitford in Wisconsin
- **Context**: U.S. Supreme Court case addressing alleged [[gerrymandering]] in Wisconsin.
- **Outcome**: Highlights the legal and democratic challenges associated with manipulating boundaries for political advantage.
## Geographic Implications
- **[[Geographic Information System|GIS]] Technology**: Facilitates rapid redrawing of boundaries, posing a dilemma for democracy.
- **Impact**: The location of district boundaries can significantly influence election results, raising questions about fairness.
# Regions and Voting Behavior
## Red State/Blue State Dynamics
- **Analysis**: Commonly used to depict regional political preferences.
- **Limitations**: Oversimplifies complex voting patterns, especially in states with large areas but sparse populations.
- **Introduction of Purple State**: A nuanced approach to acknowledge the diversity within states and challenge binary categorizations.
## County-Level Analysis
- **Nuanced Perspective**: County-level results reveal variations not captured by state-level distinctions.
- **Complexities Unveiled**: Shading of colors provides a more accurate representation of political and cultural differences.
## Three-Dimensional Analysis
- **Cities vs. Rural Divide**: Utilizing height to represent voters per square mile unveils the urban-rural political dynamic.
- **Insights**: Rural areas mainly Republican, while cities lean Democratic, showcasing geographic disparities in voting behavior.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- How can voting outcomes reflect regional differences?
>Dividing the United States into “red states” and “blue states” is very simplistic and gives the illusion of deep regionalization in voter preferences in U.S. presidential elections.

>[!faq]- What is [[gerrymandering]]
>[[Gerrymandering]] is the manipulation of district boundaries to favor a particular political party or group.

>
>Explain how devolutionary challenges occur at different scales.
>
>Explain how innovations in communication technology challenge sovereignty.
>
>Identify why supranational organizations are formed and how they challenge state sovereignty.
# Devolutionary Forces:
1. **Ethnic Cleansing:** Involves the forced removal of an [[Ethnicity|ethnic group]] by another to create ethnically homogeneous territories. Examples include the ethnic wars in Yugoslavia, genocide in Sudan's Darfur [[Region]], and ethnic cleansing in Myanmar against the Rohingya.
2. **Terrorism:** Involves the calculated use of violence against civilians and symbolic targets to publicize a cause, intimidate, or coerce. Examples range from international terrorism like the 9/11 attacks to domestic terrorism such as the Oklahoma City bombing.
3. **[[Irredentism]]:** Occurs when an ethnic majority ruling one country seeks to reunite with people of the same [[Ethnicity]] who are minorities in a neighboring country. For instance, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
4. **Disintegration of States:** Sometimes, smaller, culturally homogenous regions decide to break off from larger states. The example here is South Sudan, which gained independence from Sudan but still faces internal and external conflicts.
**Maintaining Sovereignty in the Internet Age:**
Governments attempt to impose their laws and defend cultural norms in the Internet age. Countries may restrict access to technological hardware or control the information citizens receive. Examples include China's Great Firewall, censorship agreements with companies like Google, and efforts to counteract pro-Hong Kong activism.
**Supranationalism:**
In recent decades, globalisation has led countries to relinquish some territorial sovereignty in exchange for greater global power. Supranationalism occurs when nation-states cede some sovereign rights to a larger political body. Examples include the [[United Nations]] ([[United Nations|UN]]), [[European Union]] (EU), and [[African Union]] (AU).
**[[United Nations|UN]], EU, and AU:**
- **[[United Nations]] ([[United Nations|UN]]):** Established in 1945, it consists of 193 member states and aims to maintain international peace and security. The [[United Nations|UN]] Security Council plays a crucial role in addressing threats and acts of aggression.

- **[[European Union]] (EU):** Formed in 1993, it's a political, economic, and social union of 28 European countries. It promotes the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital among its members. The EU requires member nations to give up some sovereign powers.

- **[[African Union]] (AU):** Launched in 2002, it seeks to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence of its member states. The AU aims for greater unity, solidarity, economic development, and democratic principles in Africa.
**Transnational and Environmental Challenges:**
Organizations like UNESCO and the [[Arctic Council]] address challenges that cross borders, emphasizing cooperation for peace, sustainable development, and environmental protection.
**Trade Agreements:**
Regional trading blocs like NAFTA-USMCA and ASEAN aim to reduce or eliminate taxes, promote the free flow of goods and services, achieve economies of scale, and facilitate economic growth among member countries.
**Military Alliances:**
Military alliances, such as NATO, involve intergovernmental cooperation for political and military purposes, ensuring the freedom and security of member countries.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- How do devolutionary challenges occur at different scales?
>Devolutionary can occur at the [[Regional Scale|regional scale]] which can make new states, or even dissolve an entire [[State|State]] 

>[!faq]- How do innovations in communication technology challenge sovereignty?
>The internet gets rid of political boundaries due to interconnectedness causing a loss of [[State|State]] sovereignty

>
>Explain centripetal forces and their impacts on states.
# Failed States
- **Definition of Failed State:** A failed state is one whose political or economic system has become so weak that the government loses control.
- **Causes of Failure:** Reasons for state failure include corruption, loss of trust in the government, and the inability to project authority.
- **Indicators of Failure:** Civil wars, genocide, and ethnic violence can contribute to the collapse of a state.
- **Measurement:** The classification of a state as "failed" may vary among organizations, with different criteria and assessments. The Fragile States Index (FSI) is one such measure.
- **Examples:** Yemen and Venezuela are presented as examples of failed states, each facing unique challenges contributing to their fragile conditions.
# Uneven Development
- **Definition:** Uneven development refers to the situation where [[core states]] have advanced economies and high living standards, while peripheral states have less industrial development and lower consumption of manufactured goods.
- **Causes:** Neocolonialism is identified as a factor leading to uneven development, with examples such as cocoa production in [[Africa#West Africa|West Africa]] and raw material extraction in Latin America.
- **Local Scale Impact:** Uneven development is not only a global or regional issue but can manifest locally, leading to dissatisfaction, protests, and violence.
# Stateless Nations
- **Definition:** Stateless nations, like the Kurds in Central Asia, can act as a [[Centrifugal Force]] within the nations they occupy.
- **Example:** The Kurdish referendum for secession from Iraq is discussed, creating tension between ethnic Kurds and the central government.
# Ethnic Nationalist Movements
- **[[Centrifugal Force]]:** Culturally distinct regions with national boundaries can be a [[Centrifugal Force]], particularly when the majority [[Ethnicity|ethnic group]] marginalizes minority groups.
- **Example:** Myanmar is cited as a case where ethnic Burmans control the central territory, leading to strong centrifugal and devolutionary forces.
# Nationalism
- **[[Centripetal Force]]:** Nationalism is described as a [[Centripetal Force]], promoting unity among residents who share a national identity.
- **Multicultural States:** In multicultural states, citizens often identify with the nation rather than their specific ethnic backgrounds.
- **Leadership Role:** Leaders play a role in promoting nationalism by seeking allegiance, loyalty, and commitment to the country.
# Infrastructure Development
- **Importance:** Infrastructure, including transportation and communication systems, is highlighted as a [[Centripetal Force]] that promotes economic and social development.
- **Equitable Infrastructure:** Access to equitable infrastructure is crucial for economic growth, quality of life, and reducing disparities.
# Cultural Cohesion
- **[[Centripetal Force]]:** Cultural cohesion, achieved through shared traditions, symbols, and institutions, is emphasized as crucial for a country's success.
- **Unifying Symbols:** Flags, national anthems, sports teams, and royalty are cited as examples of unifying symbols that contribute to cultural cohesion.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- What are centrifugal forces
>Centrifugal forces are things that separate people.

>[!faq]- What are centripetal forces
