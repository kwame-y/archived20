# Explaining International Trade
>For half a millennium, geographers and economists have tried to answer the question “Why do countries trade with one another?” As the world has changed, so have the explanations for trade.
- In the 16th century (1500-1600) countries traded because of [[mercantilism]]
	- This means they tried to export more than they imported to gain money
	- [[Colonialism|Colonialism]] was a major part of the mercantilist system in [[Europe]], and formed a [[monopoly]] to their colonies
	- [[Protectionism]] are trade rules that restrict imports to protect domestic industries & jobs
		- Also a major part of [[mercantilism|mercantilism]]
- ![[Venice Mercantilism.png]] Venice was also a major mercantilist trade centre
- Adam Smith argued that the reason why countries trade is because of [[absolute advantage]]
	- Which is a country's ability to make a good or service more efficiently than another
	- Hr argued against [[protectionism]] because he believed in free movement of trade, and that the market would direct the flow based on [[absolute advantage|absolute advantage]]  
- David Ricardo argued [[absolute advantage|absolute advantage]] would mean the trade would be very unequal, so he proposed that trade happens because of [[comparative advantage]]
	- This is when a country is able to produce one product more efficiently than other products in its [[economy]]
	- Countries will specialise in industries in which it has a [[comparative advantage|comparative advantage]] and export them, while importing the non-[[comparative advantage|comparative advantage]] items
>- Complementarity is a measure of how well one country’s export profile matches another country’s import profile. A high degree of complementarity can provide the basis for successful trade.
- Some people recognise the rise of [[Transnational Corporation|transnational corporations]]
	- A [[Transnational Corporation|TNC]] is a firm with the power to coordinate and control operations in more than one country, even if it does not own those operations
		- [[Competitive advantage]] is a firms ability to outperform other [[Transnational Corporation|TNC]]s in the industry
		- They work to keep a [[competitive advantage]] by upgrading
# Emerging Patterns of Global Trade 
- International trade has increased importance to the world economy because of [[globalisation]]
	- The world GDP growth matched with the increase in world trade volume
- Through history international trade meant between countries but today, it's mostly [[Transnational Corporation|TNCs]] doing the trading
	- TNCs account for 2/3 of world exports
	- Most TNC trade happens inside the TNC not different ones as a TNC has multiple firms around the world
- Growth in global trade is also uneven
	- 10 countries make up over 50% of total world trade 
		- [[China]] leads the trade of goods
		- While the [[United States of America|US]] leads trade of commercial services
	- [[Asia]] has had the highest export growth, while Africa decreased
# Trade Organisations
- [[Protectionism|Protectionism]] has reduced the flow of exports & imports in history
- So some countries work together to reduce the trade barriers made
	- [[Neoliberalism]] has displaced [[protectionism]] as an economic strategy
		- [[Neoliberalism|Neoliberalism]] holds a large rand of pro-market & anti-government positions`
			- Reducing government ownership & regulation
			- Promoting privatisation
			- Market-based solutions
		- New international trade organizations have been made based on the shift to [[neoliberalism]]
			- The [[United Nations|UN]] is a prime example, it started the [[International Monetary Fund]] & the World Bank
				- The [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]] seeks global monetary cooperation, financial stability, and sustainable economic growth
				- It provides loans to countries that are extremely deep in debt
				- And provides funding for developing countries
			- The [[United Nations|UN]] also established the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
				- An agreement to bring down trade barriers (tariffs)
# Regional Trade Agreements
>In addition to the global-scale efforts of the IMF, World Bank, and WTO, there have been numerous other initiatives at regional scales. These take various forms, such as free-trade agreements and customs unions.
## Free-Trade Agreements
>A free-trade agreement is a treaty between two or more countries that reduces tariffs and promotes foreign investment. Tariffs are taxes (sometimes called duties) on imported goods and services. The tariff is a percentage of the total cost of the product, including shipping, thus raising the price of the imported product.
- The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) eliminates some tariffs and trade barriers between the three countries & increased international trade volume between them (unevenly)
- The EU however has no tariffs and barriers
## [[Customs Union|Customs Unions]]
- A [[customs union]] is a free-trade agreement between member countries, with an external trade policy for nonmembers
	- EUCU
	- Mercosur
	- A bloc of countries can remove tariffs in the union, but still enforce them for nonmembers
## Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
- A trade agreement to regulate oil output, founded in 1965 by [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Venezuela]] to coordinate oil production and avoid trade competition with memebers
	- OPEC controls 44% of the worlds oil & influences global oil supply and prices
# Government Initiatives
- Tariffs are targeted at specific countries an exports
	- Retaliation can start tariff wars in which trade and economic growth is slowed extremely in both countries
- Embargos are bans on trade with a country or product
# The Importance of Financial Markets
>The world economy is now so interconnected that most consumer purchases are dependent on activities occurring in multiple countries. Let’s explore how this level of interdependence developed and what it means for economic development.
- Computers and new technology allow for near-instantaneous trade of financial products (stocks), investors can buy & sell stocks in response to the economic conditions quickly, this has speed up global trade
- Financial markets are where stocks & other financial goods are traded (New York Stock Exchange)
## International Financial Crises
>The world economy has experienced a series of financial crises that negatively affected virtually every country in the world. Each crisis demonstrated how financial markets have made the world increasingly interconnected and its countries interdependent.
## 1980s Latin American Debt Crisis
- OPEC had an embargo in 1973 that brought oil prices up 400%
	- OPEC countries got lots of money and invested their cash into international banks
	- The flood of money into the banks caused a global money surplus which lowered international credit
- Latin American countries took advantage and borrowed lots of money for [[Industrialisation|Industrialisation]]
	- Their debt went up much higher than their GDP growth
- This caused a debt crisis
	- Banks cut off credit to Latin America, and the IMF was forced to intervene and help
## Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2008
>The growing importance of financial markets has created incentives for bankers to develop new, often risky, financial products. If these financial products lose money, the effects on the world economy can be devastating, as in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008.
- Banks started offering more mortgages in the late 1990s to people with little financial resources
	- They were risky as it wasn't the borrowers' income being used to pay
- Banks put all the loans they gave out and used it as a product that will earn investors more money when it was paid back
	- So they bought them
- This caused a large amount of homebuyers which brought up the price of homes, then in 2006 house prices plunged
	- Mortgage holders now owed more than the worth of the houses
	- People started now paying loans, causing the value of the debt products to collapse
- Investment banks almost failed until the government spammed money to fix it
- The crisis caused mass unemployment & bankruptcies around the world
# Economic Development
>The rising importance of financial markets in the world economy has reinforced patterns of geographically uneven development. A small number of cities, mostly in developed countries, now control most international financial transactions. These cities include [[New York]], [[London]], [[Chicago]], [[Zurich]], [[Tokyo]], and [[San Francisco]]. However, [[Asia]] is emerging as an important player in the financial sector, and Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Singapore are among the top nine cities that together control about three-quarters of the world’s financial transactions.
- Global financial crises affect developing and developed countries differently
	- The Latin American debt crisis lead to a change in development strategy
		- They were trying to do [[Import substitution industrialisation]]
			- Which is a policy that tries to replaced imported goods with domestic goods and reduce dependence
		- They had to turn to the IMF for help and they demanded them to leave behind [[Import substitution industrialisation|Import substitution industrialisation]]
