# Notes
## Cultural Hearths

### Definition
- **[[Cultural Hearth]]:** A geographic area where important cultural innovations, ideas, traits, and practices originate and spread. It is often the place most strongly associated with a particular cultural phenomenon.
### Ethnic Cultures and Hearths
- **Formation of Ethnic Groups:** Ethnic groups form within cultural hearths, and they often occupy defined areas, both rural and urban.
- **[[Migration]] and [[Ethnicity]]:** [[Migration]] is a principal way in which groups become ethnic or racialized when relocating to a new place.
	- Ex. The [[Migration]] of a prominent Swedish population to Minnesota in the United States in the 1890s is an example of an [[Ethnicity|ethnic group]] relocating to a place reminiscent of their homeland.
- **Cultural Diffusion:** When ethnic groups expand beyond their [[Cultural Hearth]], they recreate some but not all of the traits of the [[Hearth]].
### Gender Roles and Hearths
- **Regional Variation in [[Gender]] Norms:** Gender norms vary from [[Region]] to [[Region]]. For example, the wearing of the hijab for women in [[Europe]] has been influenced by the [[Migration]] of Muslims into the [[Region]].
- **Professions and [[Gender]]:** Many professions are gendered, and changes in gender norms often diffuse from cultural hearths in developed economies to developing economies.
- **Modern Cultural Norms:** Modern cultural norms about gender roles diffuse from cultural hearths of developed economies to developing economies.
## Cultural Regions
### Language and Word Preferences
- **Variation in Speech:** Despite a few language families, spatial variation in speech is complex.
- **Indo-European Language Family:** About half of the world's population speaks a language from the Indo-European family.
- **Religious Boundaries:** Religious boundaries are associated with regional patterns, and religious adherence often exhibits a complex pattern in various parts of the world.
- **Major Religions' Distribution:** The world distribution of major religions, including Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, is concentrated spatially in three principal [[Cultural Hearth|culture hearth]] areas from which they diffused.
### Religions Diffuse from their Hearths
#### Semitic [[Religious Hearth]]
- **Major Monotheistic Faiths:** Judaism, Christianity, and Islam originated among people who spoke Semitic languages in southwestern Asia (Middle East).
- **Diffusion:** Religions spread through both relocation and expansion diffusion.
- **[[Hierarchical Diffusion]]:** Christianity and Islam spread hierarchically, often converting kings or tribal leaders.
#### Indus-Ganga [[Religious Hearth]]
- **Birthplace of Hinduism and Buddhism:** The plains fringing the northern edge of the Indian subcontinent gave birth to Hinduism and Buddhism.
- **Diffusion:** Hinduism diffused from its origin, with missionaries carrying the faith to overseas areas.
#### East Asian [[Religious Hearth]]
- **Founders:** Confucianism and Taoism, founded by Confucius and Lao Tzu respectively, gained wide acceptance when promoted by ruling elites.
- **Diffusion:** Taoism and Confucianism spread through trade, military conquest, and [[Migration]] of Chinese and Japanese populations.
## Language Families
### Indo-European Language Family
- **Dominance:** The largest and most widespread language family, spoken on all continents.
- **Subfamilies:** Romance, Slavic, Germanic, Indic, Celtic, and Iranic are Indo-European subfamilies.
- **Diffusion:** Indo-European languages spread through relocation and expansion diffusion.
- **Vocabulary similarity:** Similarities in vocabulary, like the word "mother" in various Indo-European languages, demonstrate their common ancestry.
### Other Major Language Families
- **Sino-Tibetan:** Second only to Indo-European in numbers of native speakers, with branches Sino- and Tibeto-Burman originating in the Himalayan Plateau.
- **Afro-Asiatic:** Divided into Semitic and Hamitic, with Arabic as the most widespread Semitic language.
## Toponyms
- **Definition:** Toponyms are place-names given to settlements, terrain features, streams, etc.
- **Toponyms and Culture:** Reflect spatial patterns of language, dialect, and [[Ethnicity]].
- **Persistence of Toponyms:** Place-names often survive long after the culture that produced them vanishes.
- **Examples:** The persistence of Native American toponyms in the United States and the influence of Moorish rule in Spain and Portugal.
## Universalizing and Ethnic Religions
**Religions worldwide can be classified into two main categories: universalizing and ethnic faiths.** The distinction lies in their approach to membership and conversion.
### Universalizing Religions
**Universalizing religions actively seek new members and aim to convert all of humanity because they believe their message has universal importance.** Examples of universalizing religions include Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Sikhism.
#### Christianity
**Christianity, the world's largest religion, claims 2.3 billion followers, constituting about a third of the global population. Christians are monotheistic, with some believing in the Holy Trinity.** The religion has **several branches, including Roman Catholics, Protestants, and Eastern Christians. The latter includes the Armenian Church, Coptic Church, Maronites, Nestorians, and the Eastern Orthodox Church**. Christianity has evolved and fragmented over time, with intense missionary efforts making Africa and [[Asia]] its fastest-growing regions.
#### Islam
**Islam, claiming 1.8 billion followers, is a proselytic faith founded by Muhammad. Muslims worship Allah and follow the Five Pillars of the faith, including prayer, almsgiving, fasting, and pilgrimage to Mecca.** Islam has two main divisions: **Sunni and Shi'ite. The religion's strength is prominent in the Arabic-speaking lands and is the fastest-growing world religion due to conversion efforts and high birth rates**.
#### Buddhism
**Buddhism, originating from Hinduism, emphasizes the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path to achieve enlightenment (nirvana).** It spread across [[Asia]] and continues to diffuse globally, with around 4 million Buddhists in the United States resulting from [[Relocation Diffusion]].
### Ethnic Religions
**In contrast, ethnic religions are tied to specific ethnic or tribal groups and do not actively seek converts.** Their spatial distribution is influenced by [[Migration]], sacred places, and cultural hearths.
#### Judaism
**Judaism, a 4000-year-old religion, is the first major monotheistic faith. It remains an ethnic religion, with a diaspora scattering Jews from their original [[Hearth]].** The Holocaust further dispersed Jews, and today, Judaism has approximately 15 million adherents globally.
#### Hinduism
**Hinduism, closely tied to India, has about 1.1 billion adherents. It is polytheistic, recognizing one supreme god (Brahman) and various manifestations.** Hindus believe in reincarnation, karma, and strive for moksha. **Hinduism has diverse groups, and its diffusion is influenced by [[Migration]] and sacred places.**
#### Animism
**Animistic beliefs, not forming organized religious groups, are practiced by about 240 million people. Animists believe that spirits exist in various natural entities. Shaman serves as an intermediary between people and spirits.** Animistic elements can also be found in established religions, such as Shintoism in Japan.
### Distribution of Ethnic Religions
**The spatial distribution of ethnic religions is distinct due to their non-universalizing nature. [[Migration]] plays a crucial role in their dispersal, with sacred places anchoring religious communities.**
	Ex. the worldwide dispersion of Judaism and the spread of Hinduism through [[Relocation Diffusion]]. 
Sacred spaces, like rivers and mountains, hold significance, and adherence to them can lead to religious segregation, as seen in Mecca.
# How does this connect to your life and experiences?
This connects to my life because I am apart of a universal religion.

# Key Questions
>[!faq]- How do languages and cultural systems form and then diffuse?
>Languages and cultural systems form through a combination of social interaction and historical developments and they diffuse through [[Migration]], trade, conquest, and communication.

>[!faq]- How do universalizing religions spread
>Universalizing religions spread through missionary activities, proselytism, and the spread of their core beliefs to diverse populations with the aim of gaining new followers worldwide.
