# Failed States
- **Definition of Failed State:** A failed state is one whose political or economic system has become so weak that the government loses control.
- **Causes of Failure:** Reasons for state failure include corruption, loss of trust in the government, and the inability to project authority.
- **Indicators of Failure:** Civil wars, genocide, and ethnic violence can contribute to the collapse of a state.
- **Measurement:** The classification of a state as "failed" may vary among organizations, with different criteria and assessments. The Fragile States Index (FSI) is one such measure.
- **Examples:** Yemen and Venezuela are presented as examples of failed states, each facing unique challenges contributing to their fragile conditions.
# Uneven Development
- **Definition:** Uneven development refers to the situation where [[core states]] have advanced economies and high living standards, while peripheral states have less industrial development and lower consumption of manufactured goods.
- **Causes:** Neocolonialism is identified as a factor leading to uneven development, with examples such as cocoa production in [[Africa#West Africa|West Africa]] and raw material extraction in Latin America.
- **Local Scale Impact:** Uneven development is not only a global or regional issue but can manifest locally, leading to dissatisfaction, protests, and violence.
# Stateless Nations
- **Definition:** Stateless nations, like the Kurds in Central Asia, can act as a [[Centrifugal Force]] within the nations they occupy.
- **Example:** The Kurdish referendum for secession from Iraq is discussed, creating tension between ethnic Kurds and the central government.
# Ethnic Nationalist Movements
- **[[Centrifugal Force]]:** Culturally distinct regions with national boundaries can be a [[Centrifugal Force]], particularly when the majority [[Ethnicity|ethnic group]] marginalizes minority groups.
- **Example:** Myanmar is cited as a case where ethnic Burmans control the central territory, leading to strong centrifugal and devolutionary forces.
# Nationalism
- **[[Centripetal Force]]:** Nationalism is described as a [[Centripetal Force]], promoting unity among residents who share a national identity.
- **Multicultural States:** In multicultural states, citizens often identify with the nation rather than their specific ethnic backgrounds.
- **Leadership Role:** Leaders play a role in promoting nationalism by seeking allegiance, loyalty, and commitment to the country.
# Infrastructure Development
- **Importance:** Infrastructure, including transportation and communication systems, is highlighted as a [[Centripetal Force]] that promotes economic and social development.
- **Equitable Infrastructure:** Access to equitable infrastructure is crucial for economic growth, quality of life, and reducing disparities.
# Cultural Cohesion
- **[[Centripetal Force]]:** Cultural cohesion, achieved through shared traditions, symbols, and institutions, is emphasized as crucial for a country's success.
- **Unifying Symbols:** Flags, national anthems, sports teams, and royalty are cited as examples of unifying symbols that contribute to cultural cohesion.
