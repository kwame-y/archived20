# Deindustrialisation in the Core
>In the years following World War II, the United States was by far the world’s manufacturing leader. Then, in the early 1970s, a significant restructuring of the world economy began, including deindustrialisation in the United States and other core regions.
## The Decline of Manufacturing Sector Employment
- After WW2 a period of growth called Fordism occurred
	- It refers to the economic & social arrangement based on mass production, high amounts of people in labor unions, stable/full-time manufacturing employment, and wages that allow mass consumption
	- It's named after Henry Ford, who utilised assembly lines to mass produce cars
		- He also brought higher standards of living
		- And expanded the middle class
- In 1970s industrial [[infrastructure|infrastructure]] became outdated
	- Costs of business increased in old manufacturing centres
	- Land value, wages, and taxes were high
	- Old transportation [[infrastructure|infrastructure]] caused congestion
- Because of this, [[corporate disinvestment]] became a widespread happenstance
	>- [[Corporate disinvestment]] is a process in which companies stop investing in factory construction, equipment, and improvement and begin selling off assets, such as machinery, buildings, and land.
	- ==As disinvestment happened companies shifted investment into manufacturing in the periphery & semi-periphery==
- Relocation of manufacturing and support services from one country to another is known as [[offshoring]].
	- [[Offshoring]] reduces costs because wages are lower in the periphery
- [[Outsourcing]] is when a firm gives part of its internal operations to a third party
	- A computer company might sell its touchscreen factory to another company and then buy screens from them
	- Or remove its accounting department and have it outsourced instead
- All of these factors led to [[deindustrialisation]] and a movement away from [[fordism]]
	- In 1950 [[deindustrialisation|deindustrialisation]] caused the percentage of employment in the manufacturing sector to go from 32% to 8.4% in 2020
		- ==This was due to improvements in productivity not a decrease in output==
	- [[Deindustrialisation]] ruined many manufacturing regions like [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], and [[Pennsylvania]]
		- As base industries left, the supporting industries had to shut down
## The Rise of Service Sector Employment
- As manufacturing sector jobs decreased, the service industry boomed(including the [[tertiary sector|tertiary sector]], [[Quaternary Sector|quaternary sector]], and [[quinary sector]])\
	- By 2020 the service sector grew to 71.2% of all private sector employment
	- The service sector makes up the largest share of GDP in core regions
		- In the United States, the service sector is 4 times as large, GDP wise
# [[Industrialisation|Industrialisation]] in the [[Periphery States|Periphery]]
>The effects of restructuring on the periphery and semi-periphery are nearly mirror images of the effects in the core. The shift of manufacturing from the core to the periphery and semi-periphery has profoundly reshaped the geography of [[Industrialisation]], creating a new international division of labor in the process.
## [[Special Economic Zone]](s)
- Since the 1970s developing countries have attracted foreign investors & boosting [[Industrialisation]] by making [[Special Economic Zone|special economic zones]]
	- An [[Special Economic Zone|SEZ]] is an area in a country in which business & trade laws are different from the rest of the country
		- In an [[Special Economic Zone|SEZ]] the government might lower taxes, or help [[Transnational Corporation|TNCs]] set up a factory
		- The number of [[Special Economic Zone|SEZs]] has spiked
			- In 1975 only 29 countries had them, in 2019 147 countries had them ==(especially developing countries)==
	- The most important type of SEZs are [[export processing zones]] & [[free-trade zones]]
		- EPZs are zones with incentives to attract investment to places where materials undergo processing or assembly before being exported
			- Goods shipped from an EPZ don't have tariffs or other taxes
			- TNCs invest in EPZs(in developing countries) because production costs are lower than the core
				- Low wages in the periphery
				- Labor unions are rare in EPZs too, allowing companies to exploit workers
		- FTZs are designated duty-free zones for providing warehousing, storage, and distribution facilities for trade & export
			- They are located where international trade is focused
				- Seaports
				- Airports
				- Border Crossings
## Global-Scale Production Systems
- The rapid increase in number of SEZs, EPZs, and FTZs is because of the interconnected global economy
	- SEZs, EPZs, & FTZs are a result of firms being in competition that caused governments to attract them for foreign investment
	- They are also the cause of our interconnected world due to all the foreign investments and such
- There are 5000 FTZs in 147 countries which forms a system in which goods move across borders without duties
	- Duties aren't paid until the product is complete, which keeps prices to consumers low
- EPZs have restructured the world economy as employment in the core has shifted from secondary to tertiary & quaternary, and primary to secondary & tertiary in semi-periphery countries
- In 1980 [[China|China]] made its first SEZs, most of them were EPZ seaport cities
	- The low wages, closeness to the worlds largest market, investment, & environment of the EPZs made them perfect for investors and they flooded into
	- They allowed for China to transform into a manufacturing economy and fuelled 30 years of economic growth 
		- By 2020 China accounted for 2/3 of the worlds EPZ employment
- Chinas shift to manufacturing and other developing countries as shown the new [[international division of labor|international division of labor]], which is the global enlarging of manufacturing, [[Transnational Corporation|Transnational Corporation]]s have also influenced global manufacturing operations, by focusing in the low-wage countries, which also increased labor-intensive manufacturing 
- This allowed China to become the worlds manufacturing leader, and now the largest GDP
# Post-Fordism
- Post-Fordism is the shift on manufacturing centres to dispersed production sites
	- Mass Production → Batch Production
	- Permanent Workforce → Temporary Employee & Contract Workers
		- Flexibility
>Just-in-time-manufacturing (JIT) is the production of small batches of goods as needed by customer demand. JIT manufacturing (also called JIT delivery) reduces warehousing costs while shortening delivery times between suppliers and manufactures. It also decreases a company’s dependence on a large, permanent factory workforce in favor of temporary employees and contract workers. That is, the company can flexibly expand the workforce during peak-demand periods, then reduce the workforce in low-demand periods.
- In Post-Fordism the importance of economies of scale decreases(when the cost per-unit decreases as outputs increase)
- Cost reductions are done through JIT production, which removes the need for managing inventory
# The Role of High-Technology Industries
- A high-tech industry uses advanced tech and has the highest R&D
	- They are made up off computers, communications and electronics, and pharmaceuticals
		- They have lots of money investment
		- And use the tech in production
			- All Quaternary industries, that need highly educated, skilled workforce
- Oil & Gas dominated the top 10 most valued companies in 1980, in 2020 they all disappeared and were replaced by high-tech companies
- It also shows how much the world economy has grown under Post-Fordism
	- All of 1980s top 10 doesn't event make 1/4 of the current #1
	- China is also up there
>Agglomeration economies occur where firms cluster spatially in order to take advantage of geographic concentrations of skilled labor and industry suppliers, specialized infrastructure, and ease of face-to-face contact with industry participants. They are most commonly found in or near large metropolitan areas.
- Agglomeration economies seem to go against the whole spatially dispersed part of post-Fordism
	- Clustering reducing costs, and increases interaction
	- Silicon Valley includes world class universities, 3 international airports, and 5 tech HQs
		- Almost nothing is actually manufactured there, most things are R&D
	- Multiplier effects may occur(one industry indirectly creating more & more) in San Fran Bay its estimated that per 1 job generated by the high-tech sector, 4.3 are made in other fields helping grow the area
>Growth poles are geographically pinpointed centers of economic activity organized around a designated industry, commonly in the high-tech sector.
- They usually fail if are too small or too many
	- Work best when investment is concentrated in one area that can grow
