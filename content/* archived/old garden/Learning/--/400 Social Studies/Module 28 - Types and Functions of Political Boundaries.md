# Types of Country Boundaries
- **Delimitation and Demarcation**: The process involves both delimitation, the identification of limits, and demarcation, the physical separation of those limits. The median line principle is an illustration, notably visible in the Delaware River.
## Relic Boundaries
- **Definition**: Relic boundaries, though obsolete as international borders, endure as cultural imprints in the landscape.
- **Examples**:
    - *Hadrian’s Wall*: Constructed in 122 CE to fortify the Roman Empire, it now stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with remnants and hiking paths.
    - *Berlin Wall*: Erected post-World War II, it symbolized the division of East and West Germany until its dismantling in 1989.
## [[Superimposed Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Imposed without regard to existing cultural boundaries, often exacerbating conflicts.
- **Example**: Belgium's imposition of boundaries on Rwanda and Burundi during colonialism, illustrating the disregard for pre-existing cultural divisions.
## [[Subsequent Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Evolving with the [[Cultural Landscape]], set as groups settle in new territories.
- **Examples**:
    - *China-Vietnam Border*: Negotiated post-Lý–Song War, demarcated by rivers, formalized in the Treaty of Tientsin (1885).
    - *US-Canada Border*: Established through treaties like the Webster–Ashburton Treaty (1842), solidifying boundaries from Maine to Minnesota.
## [[Antecedent Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Identified before area settlement.
- **Examples**:
    - *49th Parallel*: Delimited in 1846 between the US and Canada.
    - *Malaysia-Indonesia Border on Borneo*: Outlined during the colonial period, defined by the Anglo–Dutch Treaty of 1891.
## [[Geometric Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Regular, often straight lines irrespective of physical or cultural features.
- **Examples**:
    - *US-Canada Border West of Lake of the Woods*: An example of a geometric boundary.
    - *African Colonial Boundaries*: Often superimposed geometric lines, a consequence of colonial powers' division during decolonization.
## [[Consequent Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Formed to accommodate existing cultural differences.
- **Examples**:
    - *China-Vietnam Border*: Also serving as a consequent boundary between two distinct cultures.
    - *Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland Border*: Dividing along religious lines, primarily Protestant and Catholic.
## Demilitarized Zones
- **Definition**: Designated areas where treaties prohibit military activities.
- **Examples**:
    - *Korean Peninsula DMZ*: Fortified along latitude 38° N, it reflects historical geopolitical tensions.
    - *Idlib Demilitarization*: 2018 agreement between Turkey and Russia in Syria's Idlib [[Region]], emphasizing conflict resolution.
# Political Agreements
## Berlin Conference
- **Context**: Convened in 1884–1885 to regulate European colonization in Africa.
- **Outcomes**: Resulted in colonial partitioning, overshadowing existing African autonomy, and establishing enduring boundaries post-WWII.
# Buffer States
- **Definition**: Independent yet politically and economically weak countries strategically positioned between powerful states.
- **Example**: Thailand, an independent state serving as a buffer between British and French colonial empires in [[Asia]].
# Satellite States
- **Definition**: Nominally independent countries under the political, military, and economic control of a more powerful state.
- **Example**: Poland, transitioning into a Soviet satellite state post-WWII as part of the Eastern Bloc.
# The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] ([[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]])
- **Definition**: Established in 1982, [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]] defines territorial boundaries and rights to the sea.
- **Significance**: Introduced four zones, particularly the [[Exclusive Economic Zones|Exclusive Economic Zone]] ([[Exclusive Economic Zones|EEZ]]), altering geopolitical dynamics globally.
- **Example**: Spratly Islands dispute, highlighting the impact of [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]] on maritime claims.
# Global Warming and Rising Sea Levels
- **Impact on Boundaries**: Sea level rise (SLR) since the 1880s, accelerating, leading to changes in territorial boundaries, loss of access to fisheries, and potential international disputes.
- **Example**: Implications in the Arctic Circle, where melting ice opens new shipping routes.
- **Note**: Findings of international tribunals may not represent final outcomes in disputes.
# Key Questions 
>[!faq]- What are the different types of country boundaries?
>Relic, Antecedent, Geometric, Superimposed, Consequent/Subsequent 

>[!faq]- What is an [[Exclusive Economic Zones|EEZ]]
>An [[Exclusive Economic Zones|Exclusive Economic Zone]] ([[Exclusive Economic Zones|EEZ]]) is an area of the sea prescribed by [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]] in which a country has special rights regarding the use of marine resources within 200 nautical miles of it’s shoreline
