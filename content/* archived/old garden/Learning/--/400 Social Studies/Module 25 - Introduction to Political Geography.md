>Describe the world political map and what we can learn from it.
>
>Define the different types of political entities.
# Independent [[State|States]] and Sovereignty
- **Most modern states are independent, ruling themselves** without the authority of another state.
- Exceptions exist, such as **Greenland (owned by Denmark) and unincorporated territories like Guam and Puerto Rico.**
- Some territories, like the British Virgin Islands, have self-governance while maintaining ties with a larger political entity.
- Independent states possess sovereignty, the right to control political and economic affairs within their boundaries without external interference.
- International law acknowledges states' boundaries, their right to exist independently, and their authority to govern.
## [[Nation|Nations]], [[Nation-States]], and Nationalism
- **Nation:** A community with a common identity based on shared cultural traits (language, [[Ethnicity]], religion) and bound to a homeland.
- Examples include Native American nations, the Cornish people in the UK, and the Sami in Finland.
- **Nation-State:** An ideal political unit where the nation's boundaries match the state's territorial boundaries.
- Few contemporary states fit this ideal due to globalisation, but examples include Iceland, Finland, and the Koreas.
- **Nationalism:** A sense of collective identity and belonging to a national culture, often marked by state boundaries.
- Strong nationalism can lead to efforts to preserve cultural similarity, including restricting [[Immigration]].
## Stateless Nations
- Some ethnic groups, like the Kurds, are divided by international boundaries and lack their own state.
- Stateless nations, like the Kurds, face challenges in seeking independence through political and military means.
## Multinational States, Colonialism, and Multistate Nations
- **Most countries today are multinational states**, containing multiple national, ethnic, and religious groups.
- Examples include **South Africa**, with its diverse languages, and the former Yugoslavia, which collapsed due to ethnic divisions.
- **Colonialism has left many contemporary states in Africa, [[Asia#South Asia|South Asia]], and Southeast Asia ethnically and linguistically diverse.**
- Multistate nations, like the Yoruba in [[Africa#West Africa|West Africa]], have populations divided among multiple states.
# Autonomous and Semiautonomous Regions
- **[[Autonomous Region]]:** A section or territory with a degree of self-government (e.g., Native American reservations in the United States).
- **Semiautonomous Region:** Has some degree of self-government but not complete autonomy.
- Examples include Catalonia in Spain, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, and Greenland as a semiautonomous Danish territory.
- Regions in western [[Europe]], such as Corsica (France) and Flanders/Wallonia (Belgium), seek autonomy or self-rule.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- What is the difference between a [[Nation|Nation]]  and a [[Nation-State|Nation-State]] 
>A [[Nation|Nation]] is a group of people shared cultural and historical ties, while a [[Nation-State|Nation-State]] is a state which borders match up with its [[Nation|Nation]] 

>[!faq]- What is an [[Autonomous Region]]
>An [[Autonomous Region]] is a self-governing area with a level of independence from the central government.
