## [[Agriculture]]
- Agriculture involves planting and harvesting domesticated plants and raising domesticated animals for food.
- Farmers may grow only crops, raise only animals, or do both.
>[!tip]-
>Questions on the APHG exam combine Units and concepts. Agricultural practices are cultural choices, but choices are limited by the physical environment. Know enough physical geography to explain why agricultural patterns are the way they are.
## Environmental Conditions
- The three most important elements of physical geography for [[agriculture]] are soil, topography, and climate.
### Soils
- Suitable soils for agriculture have a crumbly texture, a rich amount of organic materials, and diverse populations of microorganisms.
- The decomposition of organic matter creates an upper layer of topsoil that contains essential nutrients for plant growth.
### Topography (Landforms)
- Topography, such as mountains, plateaus, plains, hills, and valleys, affects the type of agriculture practiced.
### Climate
- Climate is the average pattern of weather over a 30-year period and plays an important role in determining the success of different kinds of agriculture.
## Types of Agriculture
- Agriculture can be divided into two broad categories: [[intensive agriculture]] and [[extensive agriculture]].
### [[Intensive Agriculture]]
- Requires high levels of labor and financial capital.
- Types of intensive agricultural practices include [[Market Gardening]], plantation agriculture, mixed crop/livestock agriculture, paddy rice agriculture, grain agriculture, livestock fattening, and dairy farming.
#### [[Market Gardening]]
- A small-scale farming system that produces a diverse mixture of vegetables and fruits, mostly for sale in local and regional markets.
- Ideal climate types for market gardening are marine west coast, mediterranean, and humid continental climates.
#### [[Plantation Agriculture]]
- Involves the specialized production of a single tropical or subtropical crop for the global marketplace.
- Individual [[plantations]] maximize the production of a single crop through [[Monocrop Culture|monocropping]].
### [[Extensive Agriculture|Extensive Agriculture]] 
- Requires minimal labor and capital in relation to the land area being farmed. It often involves low-intensity farming and the use of large land areas per unit of yield
- **[[Shifting Cultivation]]**:
    - A farming practice common in tropical lowlands and hills in the Americas, Africa, and Southeast [[Asia]].
	- Involves cultivating a plot of land until it becomes less productive over a period of about three to five years. When productivity drops, the farmer shifts to a new plot of land that has been prepared by slash-and-burn agriculture.
- **[[Nomadic Herding]]**:
	 - A form of extensive livestock grazing that involves moving herds of animals to find fresh pastures. 
		 - This practice is common in arid and semi-arid regions where the availability of forage is limited.
	- Herders move with their animals to areas with seasonal changes in rainfall and vegetation to ensure a sustainable supply of food for the livestock
- **[[Livestock Ranching]]**:
	- A form of extensive agriculture that involves raising grazing animals, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, over large land areas. This practice is common in regions with abundant grasslands.
