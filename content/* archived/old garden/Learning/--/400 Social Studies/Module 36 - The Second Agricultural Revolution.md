## The Second Agricultural Revolution
### Overview
The Second Agricultural Revolution, which lasted from the late 1600s to the 1930s, brought major changes to [[Agriculture]] and society. It was characterized by improved methods of cultivation, harvesting, and storage of farm produce. This revolution occurred independently in different regions as technology advanced and diffused throughout the industrializing world.
### Technology and Agricultural Productivity
#### Mechanization of [[Agriculture]]
Key inventions during this period included the seed drill, the steel plow, the mechanical reaper, and the tractor. These inventions increased efficiency and productivity in farming. Railroads and shipping canals also became increasingly important for shipping and selling agricultural products.
- **Seed Drill and Steel Plow**: The seed drill, invented by Jethro Tull in 1701, improved the efficiency of planting seeds. The steel plow, incorporated into a plow's design by John Deere in 1833, was lighter and stronger than previous plows, leading to greater efficiencies.
- **Mechanical Reaper**: Patented by Cyrus McCormick in 1831, the mechanical reaper increased grain yields by mechanizing the harvesting process.
- **Tractor**: The development of the internal combustible engine in the late-nineteenth century led to advancements in tractors, which increased efficiency and saved on manual labor.
- **Railroads and Shipping Canals**: These provided farmers with affordable access to distant markets, making it cheaper to transport produce and grain crops from farms to city markets and ports.
#### Agrichemicals
The development of agrichemicals, chemical compounds made from petroleum and natural gas for use in [[Agriculture]], was a major contributor to the Second Agricultural Revolution. Synthetic fertilizers and pesticides increased crop yields and reduced crop losses from pests.
### Impact of Agricultural Productivity on Farming Societies
#### Better Diet and Increased Population
**The Second Agricultural Revolution led to an increase in agricultural productivity,** which **improved people's diets and increased the population size.** Better diets led to healthier people, longer life expectancies, and higher rates of population growth.
#### Economic Shift
The increase in agricultural productivity also led to a shift from primarily subsistence farming to the production of cash crops. This shift had both positive and negative impacts on rural social structure and ecological [[Sustainability]]. As farmers began to focus on growing cash crops, the diversity of farm output declined, and farming to meet the family’s needs changed to farming for market demands.
#### Changes in Family Structure and Women's Roles[^1]
The shift from subsistence farming to cash crop farming led to changes in family structure and women's roles. Older children began to leave farms to work in towns and cities, and women often found off-farm work to earn cash. The shift toward factory production of products like cheese moved production away from farm women to factory workers, leading to changes in women's roles in the local economy.
#### Impact on the Environment
The use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides became extensive in modern [[Agriculture]]. While these advancements led to the ability to provide food for the growing urban populations, they also led to a decreasing need for farm labor to plant and harvest the crops. Many unemployed farm laborers migrated to the cities to work in factories.
