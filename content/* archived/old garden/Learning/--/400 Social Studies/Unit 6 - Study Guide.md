## Origin and Function of Cities
  - ==Early human societies were nomadic before settling into agricultural villages near fertile river valleys.==
  - Permanent settlements allowed for the development of cities as populations grew and people engaged in non-agricultural activities.
### Agricultural Surplus and Socioeconomic Stratification
- Improved farming methods led to surplus production, supporting larger populations and specialisation in occupations other than [[agriculture]].
- Socioeconomic stratification emerged, with the development of distinct social classes and early forms of government to manage resources and social relations.
## Major [[Urban Hearths|Urban Hearth]] Areas
  - The first cities appeared in regions like [[Mesopotamia]], the Nile River valley, the Indus River valley, China, Mesoamerica, the Andean highlands, and West Africa.
>These cities were small by today's standards but had ==high population densities==.
### [[Site]] & [[Situation]]
  - ==**[[Site]]**: The physical features of a location, such as terrain and water sources, were crucial for early city development.==
  - ==**[[Situation]]**: The [[relative location]] concerning surrounding features, like trade routes and resources, influenced urban growth and decline over time.==
## Diffusion of Urbanisation
  >Cities spread from their original hearth areas through spontaneous development and the influence of empires and trade.
  - **Europe**: The Greek and Roman Empires played significant roles in spreading [[urbanization]] through conquest and trade, with infrastructure like aqueducts and roads facilitating city growth.
## Rural-to-Urban Migration
>==Urban growth results from migration from rural areas and natural population increase, with industrialisation and capitalism driving migration in Europe and North America.==
- **China**: Policy reforms in the late 20th century encouraged migration from rural areas to cities, contributing to rapid urbanisation.
- **Africa and Asia**: Migration is often driven by the search for better opportunities or forced by adverse conditions, leading to urban growth despite challenges like low-skilled employment and poverty.
## Transportation and Communication
  - Innovations like railroads, streetcars, automobiles, and communication technologies (telegraph, telephone, Internet) have significantly influenced urban development by enhancing mobility and connectivity.

## Variations in Population Data Around the World
- Different countries and regions have varying definitions of what constitutes a city, town, or metropolis based on population size.
- China and the United States have different thresholds for categorizing settlements as towns, small cities, medium-sized cities, large cities, and super cities.
- The U.S. Census Bureau defines ==urban areas, urban clusters, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), and micropolitan statistical areas differently, with specific population criteria for each.==
## Cities, Towns, and Suburbs
- ==Towns are smaller than cities but can still be self-sufficient with a [[central business district]] ([[Central Business District|CBD]]) and various land uses.==
- ==Suburbs are residential areas on the outskirts of a city==, often with their own government. Older suburbs were not self-sufficient, while modern suburbs may have more amenities.
## Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)
- ==MSAs in the U.S. consist of a central county with adjacent outlying counties that are economically and socially integrated,== as measured by commuting patterns.
- The largest MSAs in the U.S. have seen varying population changes, with some increasing and others decreasing in population.
## The World [[Urbanization]] Pattern
- ==Over half of the world's population lives in cities, with projections suggesting an increase to 68% by 2050.==
- [[Urbanization]] levels vary by region, with ==higher rates in Europe, North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean, **and lower rates in Africa and Asia**.==
- Urban growth is predominantly occurring in the developing world, leading to challenges such as unemployment, inadequate housing, and strained infrastructure.
## [[Megacities]] and [[Metacities]]
- ==[[Metacities]] have regional populations over 20 million, while [[Megacities]] have over 10 million.==
- The majority of the world's largest cities are in the developing world, **a shift from 50 years ago when Western cities dominated the list**
	- *Current [[World City|World Cities]]*
		- New York
		- London
		- Tokyo
		- Paris
		- Hong Kong
		- Singapore
		- Los Angeles
		- Sydney
		- Berlin
	- *[[Metacities]]*
		- [[Tokyo]]
		- [[Delhi]]
		- [[Shanghai]]
		- [[Sao Paulo]]
		- [[Mexico City]]
	- *[[Megacities]]*
		- [[Cairo]] 
		- [[Mumbai]]
		- [[Beijing]]
		- [[Dhaka]]
		- [[Osaka–Kobe–Kyoto]]
- These classifications are based on population size, not development level or standard of living.
## [[Suburbanization]], [[Urban Sprawl|Sprawl]], and [[Decentralization]]
- **[[Suburbanization]] is the movement of people from urban core areas to the outskirts of a city.**
- ==[[Urban Sprawl]] refers to unchecked outward growth of cities,== often facilitated by **automobile dependency**.
- [[Decentralization]] involves the relocation of corporate operations to suburban areas, closer to the workforce.
## [[Edge Cities]]
- ==[[Edge Cities]] are suburban hubs of business, shopping, and entertainment, distinct from traditional downtown areas==.
- They have specific characteristics, *including significant office and retail space, and a daytime population increase due to jobs outnumbering homes*.
- [[Edge Cities]] represent a third wave of development, following the movement of homes and retail to the suburbs.
## [[Boomburbs]]
- ==[[Boomburbs]] are large suburbs with populations over 100,000 and their own governments, not core cities of metropolitan areas.==
- They have experienced **rapid population growth and are often found in the Sun Belt, with nearly half in California.**
- [[Boomburbs]] are evolving, with some developing downtown-like areas through **[[infill development]].**
## [[Exurbs 1]]
- **[[Exurbs]] are semi-rural areas beyond suburbs, often inhabited by affluent[^1] families and located near farmland, beaches, or mountains.**
- They offer a different lifestyle from cities and suburbs, ==with more space but further from urban amenities.==
- Technology has facilitated the development of [[exurbs]] by enabling remote work and access to goods and services, potentially leading to self-contained living systems.

## The Rise of World Cities
>**Cities have been central to political and economic power globally**, with Bergen, Norway, serving as a prime example during the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries due to its trade significance.
- Over centuries, the significance of cities like Bergen shifted as other cities (e.g., [[London]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Paris]], [[Rome]], [[Berlin]], [[Chicago]],[[ New York City]], and [[St. Petersburg]])[^1] **rose to prominence, especially with [[Industrialisation]].**
- Today, world cities are pivotal as command and control centers of the global economy, *housing multinational corporations, financial services, media companies, and economic/business services.* 
	- They are characterized by **cultural diversity, innovation, and environmental focus.** ==**In the beginning, only [[New York]], [[London]], and [[Tokyo]] were considered world [[cities]],** but now *[[Paris]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Sydney]], and [[Berlin]] are also included.*==
## Economic Power and [[World Cities]]
- ==World cities attract a global cosmopolitan population,== indicating a spatial concentration of economic power. **[[London]] is noted for its high concentration of high-net-worth individuals.**
- Reflecting the tastes and security concerns of the wealthy, **[[gated communities]]** within world cities offer ==exclusive services and amenities, contributing to social segregation.==
## Connections and [[World Cities]]
- **World cities facilitate [[globalisation]] through networks in transportation, communication, and business services.**
- ==World cities feature efficient transportation hubs, including harbors, airports, and rail systems, facilitating global and domestic connectivity.==
- Advanced communications systems in world cities ensure immediate access to global information for decision-makers and businesses.
- Financial markets, international law, and marketing firms in world cities provide essential services to multinational corporations and play a role in global economic dynamics.

>[!tip]- Key Points 
>- World cities have evolved from historical trade centers to modern hubs of global economic, political, and cultural influence.
>- They are characterized by their ability to attract a diverse, talented population, their role in global decision-making, and their infrastructure supporting global connectivity.
>- The rise of world cities reflects broader trends in globalisation, including the movement of the global cosmopolitan class and the development of [[gated communities]] as a response to income inequality and security concerns.

## Urban Systems
- Urban systems consist of interdependent cities connected by networks of goods, services, ideas, money, and labor.
- Territories are organized into a pattern of towns, cities, and their hinterlands.
## [[Rank-Size Rule]]
- ==Settlement populations are inversely proportional to their rank in the urban hierarchy.==
- *The second-largest city has about half the population of the largest city, the third-largest has one-third, and so on.*
## [[Primate city|Primate Cities]]
- **A [[primate city]] is significantly larger than the next largest city and dominates the country's economic, political, and cultural life.**
- Examples include [[Lagos]] in [[Nigeria]] and [[London]] in the [[UK]].
## Christaller’s [[Central Place Theory]]
- [[Central place theory]] explains the distribution of cities based on their role in providing goods and services.
- Settlements are organized hierarchically, with larger cities spaced farther apart due to their ability to draw people from greater distances for high-order goods and services.
### Assumptions of [[Central Place Theory]]
1. The region's surface is flat with no physical barriers.
2. Soil quality is consistent everywhere.
3. Population and purchasing power are evenly distributed.
4. Uniform transportation networks exist.
5. Goods and services can be sold in all directions to a certain distance.
### Hierarchy of Central Places
- First-order places: Large regional cities (e.g., New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles).
- Second-order places: Smaller cities with regional importance (e.g., Boston, Seattle, Atlanta).
- Third-order places: Towns with subregional importance.
- Fourth-order places: Small villages and hamlets with local importance.
## Modern Urban Systems
- Modern urban systems often deviate from Christaller's model due to technological, communication, and transportation advances.
- The importance of cities can rise or fall based on their location and relevance to the modern economy (e.g., San Francisco vs. Oakland).
### The Gravity Model
- Predicts interaction between places based on population size and distance.
- Interaction decreases as distance increases.
- Used by urban planners for migration studies and transportation planning.
- Controversial as a predictive tool and may perpetuate undesirable patterns.
### [[Central Place Theory]] Now
- [[Central place theory]]'s relevance is questioned in the modern context.
- Urban landscapes change, with some cities declining and others rising.
- [[Edge Cities]] and [[Exurbs 1]] develop, altering the traditional urban hierarchy.
- Technology and communication networks influence the growth of cities.

## North American Urban City Models
### **[[Burgess Concentric Zone Model]]**
  - Developed by E. W. Burgess in 1924.
  - Cities grow in concentric zones with five main areas:
    - [[Central Business District]] ([[Central Business District|CBD]])
    - Zone of Transition (low-quality housing, vice, crime)
    - Zone of Independent Workers' Homes (working-class stability)
    - Middle-Class Residences (suburbs)
    - Commuters' Zone ([[exurbs]], larger properties)
  - Growth pattern: inward to outward migration as people achieve upward mobility.
### **[[Hoyt Sector Model]]**
  - Created by Homer Hoyt in 1939.
  - City growth is influenced by transportation routes.
  - High-income residential areas develop along major transit routes.
  - Industrial sectors grow outward from the [[Central Business District|CBD]] near freight lines.
  - Middle-income housing surrounds wealthy areas; low-income areas are between manufacturing and middle-income zones.
### **[[Multiple-Nuclei Model]]**
  - Proposed by Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman in 1945.
  - Cities have multiple centers (nuclei) for different activities.
  - Growth is less focused on the [[Central Business District|CBD]] and more on suburban nodes.
  - Nodes develop independently based on their functions.
### **Galactic City (Peripheral) Model**
  - Emerged in the 1960s, influenced by Harris.
  - [[Central Business District|CBD]] is surrounded by [[Urban Sprawl]], [[Edge Cities]], and industrial districts.
  - Linked by ring roads or beltways.
  - Employment shifts from [[Central Business District|CBD]] to suburban areas.
## Bid-Rent Theory
- Land cost is higher near the city center and decreases with distance.
- Different land uses have varying utility and accessibility needs.
- High-income residences and retail stores may also be found at city edges.
- In developed countries, the poor often live near the center for public transport access.
## International Urban Models
### **Latin American City Model (Griffin-Ford Model)**
  - [[Central Business District|CBD]] divided into traditional market and modern sectors.
  - Commercial spine with elite residential sectors.
  - Middle-class in the zone of maturity; lower-middle-class in the zone of in situ accretion.
  - [[Disamenity sector]] (barrios or favelas) for the very poor.
### **Southeast Asian City Model (McGee Model)**
  - Focus on old colonial port zone, not a formal [[Central Business District|CBD]].
  - Mixed land-use zone with residential and economic activities.
  - Elite residential zones and squatter areas for middle-class residents.
### **Sub-Saharan Africa City Model**
  - Cities have three CBDs: colonial, traditional, and market zones.
  - Mixed and ethnic residential neighborhoods surround the central areas.
  - Mining and manufacturing zones from colonial times.

Status: #SocialStudies/APHG/note
Links: [[* archived/old garden/Learning/--/400 Social Studies/index]]
### Patterns of Urban Land Use
- Urban land use is influenced by utility (usefulness) and accessibility (ease of transportation).
- Early cities were unplanned, with homes and businesses established without a future city structure in mind.
- City models, such as the sector model and the multiple-nuclei model, help understand city structure, land-use patterns, and population density, though no model fits any city precisely.

### Early Travel to and Within Cities
- Initially, cities were compact, with most travel on foot. Long-distance travel was by boats, horses, or stagecoaches.
- Industrialisation led to the expansion of cities and the development of mass transit systems like horse cars, cable cars, railroads, and electric streetcars or trolleys.
- These transit systems influenced the development of residential and industrial areas, making land along transportation lines more valuable.

### The Rise of Automotive Transportation
- By the 1950s, automotive transportation became dominant, leading to the decline of mass transit systems and the expansion of cities.
- This shift changed urban land use, with lower-order commercial establishments and high-density apartment buildings developing around highway interchanges and major transfer points.

### Population and Housing Density and Residential Land-Use Patterns
- Population density is the total population divided by total land area, while perceived density is based on qualitative data.
- The population density gradient shows that density decreases as distance from the city center increases, influenced by local zoning regulations.

### Changes in Residential Building Density
- Increases in population density are largely due to increases in the numbers of residential buildings, especially in areas close to city centers like Manhattan.

### Sociocultural Patterns
- Social classes began spatially separating as early as the nineteenth century, with high-income residences located at the city's periphery and low-income residences in the center.
- This separation often coincided with racial, ethnic, and linguistic differences.

### Infrastructure and the Fiscal Squeeze
- Economic restructuring and metropolitan [[decentralization]] have led to a fiscal squeeze, where city revenues cannot keep up with the demand for services and infrastructure maintenance.
- Cities struggle with decreasing tax bases as residential populations and commercial establishments move to suburban areas.

### Changes in the Economic Base and Housing Patterns
- The industrial economic base has given way to a new economy based on digital technologies, affecting urban areas' types of jobs and housing patterns.
- High-income residents returning to city centers have displaced lower-income residents, increasing homelessness due to a lack of affordable housing.

#### Housing Discrimination: [[Redlining]] and [[Blockbusting]]
- **[[Redlining]]**: Practice of marking areas as high-risk for loans, often discriminating against minority neighborhoods.
- **[[Blockbusting]]**: Realtors inducing white homeowners to sell cheaply by suggesting the neighborhood is declining due to minority influx, then selling at higher prices to those minorities.

#### Housing Affordability
- **Affordability Issues**: Rising house prices and rents, leading to trade-offs like long commutes or overcrowded living conditions.
- **Government Assistance**: Housing choice voucher program helps, but doesn't cover security deposits, leaving many low-income families out of reach.

#### Access to Services
- **Challenges**: Poorer residents struggle to access city services like police protection, fire protection, and sanitation.
- **Solutions**: Cities try to place social service offices in or near low-income neighborhoods for better accessibility.

#### Urban Crime
- **Trends**: Significant decline in violent crime rates, but disadvantaged, segregated communities still disproportionately affected.
- **Hotspots**: Small areas within neighborhoods with higher crime rates, where policing can be effective.

#### Environmental Injustice
- **Definition**: Poor or immigrant groups facing more environmental risks than wealthier, established groups.
- **Examples**: Garbage dumps and sewage plants often located in poor neighborhoods; Flint water crisis as a case of environmental injustice.

#### [[Shantytowns|Squatter Settlements]]
- **Characteristics**: Inadequate, often illegal housing built by the poor with scavenged materials.
- **Challenges**: Lack of amenities like fresh water, electricity, and secure habitation.

#### Inclusionary Zoning
- **Purpose**: To create affordable housing options within new developments for low- and moderate-income families.

#### Local Food Movements
- **Goal**: To improve access to fresh, locally produced food, often as a response to food deserts in urban areas.

#### Urban Renewal and [[Gentrification]]
- **Urban Renewal**: Efforts to revitalize aging and rundown city areas through new construction and infrastructure improvements.
- **[[Gentrification]]**: The process where new, often wealthier, residents move into a neighborhood, leading to displacement of lower-income residents.
  - **Negative Consequences**: Displacement of original residents, loss of affordable housing, and cultural erasure.

#### Fragmentation and Local Government
- **Challenges**: Lack of coordination among various districts providing services, leading to inefficiencies.
- **Solution**: Consolidation of services to reduce hierarchy and improve service delivery, though unpopular with officials and voters.

- **Ecological Footprint and Urban [[Sustainability]]**
  - Cities have a large ecological footprint, consuming vast amounts of [[natural resources]] and impacting the environment significantly.
  - Urban [[sustainability]] aims to use resources without depleting them, facing challenges like suburban sprawl, providing clean water and air, climate change, and altering natural landscapes.

- **Urban Atmospheric Conditions**
  - Cities modify the natural environment by removing vegetation, changing landforms, and affecting air flow.
  - Urban areas experience higher temperatures, more fog and cloudiness, and increased atmospheric pollution compared to the countryside.
  - The phenomenon of urban heat islands results from hard surfaces and human activities, raising urban temperatures above those of surrounding areas.

- **Urban Water Usage and Runoff Patterns**
  - Cities are major consumers of water, with residential areas using the most.
  - [[Urbanization]] alters water runoff patterns, increasing the frequency and severity of flooding due to the replacement of vegetation with impermeable surfaces.

- **Urban Vegetation**
  - Contrary to previous beliefs, cities contain significant amounts of vegetation, which plays a crucial role in the urban ecosystem by influencing water quality, reducing temperature extremes, and providing habitats for wildlife.

- **The City’s Environmental Effects on Other Areas**
  - [[Urbanization]] can impact distant areas through increased consumption and demand for resources, such as transforming forests into grazing lands due to city dwellers' demands.

- **The Urban Footprint**
  - [[Urbanization]], often accompanied by industrialisation, stresses the natural environment by requiring large amounts of energy, food, and water.
  - The spatial extent of a city's impact on the environment is referred to as its urban footprint.

- **Water and Sanitation**
  - Many cities, especially in developing countries, face challenges with water supply and sanitation, including contaminated water sources and inadequate sewage systems.

- **Air Quality**
  - Urban areas suffer from air pollution due to high concentrations of automobiles and the use of solid fuels in low-income neighborhoods.

- **Energy**
  - Urban areas consume large amounts of energy, contributing to air pollution. Global energy consumption patterns vary, with some regions increasing their use of renewable sources.

- **Natural Disasters and Urban Risk**
  - Urban areas are vulnerable to natural disasters, which can be more destructive due to high population densities. The concept of the urban risk divide highlights disparities in disaster preparedness.

- **[[Urbanization]] and [[Sustainability]]**
  - Responses to environmental impacts vary, with some cities taking proactive measures to reduce emissions, encourage sustainable architecture, and adapt to climate change.

- **[[Brownfields|Brownfield]] Remediation and Redevelopment**
  - [[Brownfields|Brownfield]] sites, contaminated properties within cities, can be remediated and redeveloped for new uses, contributing to economic benefits and reducing [[Urban Sprawl]].

- **Farmland Protection Policy Act and Other Government Protections**
  - Policies and acts aim to protect farmland and control [[Urban Sprawl]], ensuring sustainable development.

- **Regional Planning Efforts**
  - Coordinated regional planning efforts are essential for addressing environmental impacts and promoting sustainable urban growth.
