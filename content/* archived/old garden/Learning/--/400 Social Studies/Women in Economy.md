More develop = better stuff for women

women in south asia make 90% of informal
89% sub sahara africa
55% in latin
they mainly work in informal economy
more likely to work for lower wages, unsafe spaces & discrimination \
microloans help women start business by removing economic barriers and give individuals economic independence
if the person who gets loan can't pay it back, it can be extremely detrimental to them
