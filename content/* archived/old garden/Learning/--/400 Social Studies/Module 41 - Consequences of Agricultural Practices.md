## Pollution
### Environmental Effects of Manufactured Pesticides
- **Application Methods:**
  - Farmers use aerosolized manufactured pesticides by spraying them into the air or on the ground.
  - Up to 95 percent of the pesticide spray may not reach the target, dispersing into the environment.
- ***Negative Consequences:***
  - Indiscriminate killing of insects affects insect-feeding wildlife.
  - Bee deaths impact crop pollination.
  - Pesticides entering animal bodies can cause sterilization, leading to declining wildlife populations.
- **Human Health Impact:**
  - ==Pesticides have adverse effects on humans, causing hormone disorders, skin and neurological diseases, and cancers.
  - ==Farm workers, mainly migrant laborers, face direct pesticide exposure.==
  - Recognition of the human health problem emerged in the 1970s with safeguards negotiated by farmworkers' unions.
### Agricultural Runoff
- **Ecological Problems:**
  - Polluted irrigation water runoff leads to ecological issues.
  - Pesticides spread beyond crop fields, altering food crops and living tissues of livestock.
  - Synthetic fertilizers also enter the environment through runoff from cultivated fields.
  - CAFOs contribute to fertilizer runoff.
- **Global Impact:**
  - Despite some improvements and bans on dangerous pesticides, global environmental and health issues persist.
  - Poor regulation and enforcement in developing countries contribute to escalating issues.
## Nutrient Pollution
- **Definition:**
  - Occurs when excess nutrients enter groundwater or waterways as runoff.
- **Synthetic Fertilizers and Animal Waste Impact:**
  - Trigger algae blooms, depleting [[Oxygen]] and causing mass fish deaths.
  - Identified dead zones, e.g., Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.
  - Algae blooms lead to various issues impacting pets, livestock, water treatment costs, and human health.
  - Overall, damages oceans, marine life, human and animal health, and tourism.
## Land Transformation
### ==Deforestation and Agriculture==
- **Historical Deforestation:**
  - Farmers historically increased food production by converting forests to pasture and plowing fields.
  - Notable deforestation in North America, Eurasia, and recent deforestation in Central and South America.
- **Environmental Impact:**
  - Cattle ranching and soybean production contribute to deforestation.
  - Forest clearing increases atmospheric CO2 and reduces CO2 absorption.
- **Degradation and Desertification:**
  - Poorly managed converted land can degrade, leading to desertification.
  - Desertification primarily occurs in arid and semiarid regions, contributing to global warming.
### ==Conservation Agriculture==
- **Efforts and Goals:**
  - Farmers and ranchers collaborate on water resource conservation.
  - Conservation projects by organizations like USDA and UNFAO aim to minimize soil disturbance, diversify species, and maintain soil cover.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
  - Improved soil health, increased productivity, and enhanced resilience to extreme weather.
  - High-tech and low-tech practices globally.
## Shifting Cultivation
- **Definition:**
  - Agricultural practice where infertile land is abandoned, burned, and cultivated in cycles.
  - Impact on old-growth forests and secondary vegetation.
- **Recent Issues:**
  - Increased clearing of old growth by farmers, ranchers, and loggers.
  - Instances like the 2019 Amazon fires causing environmental damage and air pollution.
## Paddy Rice Terraces
- **Honghe Hani Rice Terraces:**
  - Ingenious terraced agriculture by the Hani people in China's Ailao Mountains.
  - Sustainable integration of nature-culture system for food production and land conservation.
- **Altered Landscape:**
  - Terracing changes landscapes differently than flatland rice paddies.
  - Positive ecological practices maintained over centuries.
## Nomadic Pastoralism
- **Traditional System:**
  - Historical nomadic pastoralism minimally impacted the environment.
  - Deep understanding of landscapes, grazing areas, and water sources.
- **Contemporary Issues:**
  - Forced off traditional lands by competition.
  - Resulting erosion, desertification, and loss of soil fertility.
## Draining Wetlands
- **Land Reclamation:**
  - Water control land reclamation involves draining inundated land for agriculture.
  - Historical examples like Netherlands' dike system.
- **Environmental Loss:**
  - Extensive draining of wetlands globally, affecting biodiversity.
  - International efforts like Ramsar Convention aim to protect remaining wetlands.
## Irrigation
- **Dams and Groundwater Extraction:**
  - Dams and groundwater extraction methods expand irrigated agriculture.
  - Dams visible on landscapes; alter habitats, block fish migration.
  - Center pivot irrigation creates circular irrigated areas.
  - Deep drilling accesses ancient aquifers, impacting landscapes.
### Impacts on the Landscape
- **Arid Environment Effects:**
  - Irrigation allows deserts to bloom but poses significant environmental costs.
  - Visible effects on habitat loss, biodiversity, and altered ecosystems.
- **Case Study: Shrinking Aral Sea:**
  - Rerouting water for irrigation drastically reduced Aral Sea size.
  - Negative consequences on fishing industry and local ecosystems.
## Changing Diets
- **Historical Agriculture:**
  - Wheat and livestock dominated global agriculture until the 1960s.
  - Shift to poultry consumption and increased importance of fruits and vegetables.
- **Causes:**
  - Health concerns drive shift from beef to chicken.
  - Globalization allows access to diverse foods, influencing local cuisines.
## Changes in Women’s Roles
- **Traditional vs. Mechanized Agriculture:**
  - Women historically primary farmers; mechanization shifted roles.
  - Mechanization impacts women's access to technology.
  - Shifts in women leaving farms for urban work.
## Changes in Uses of Agricultural Products
- **Biofuels and Agriculture:**
  - Shift from food to fuel production, e.g., corn for ethanol.
  - Global consequences on field crops, livestock, habitat, and food prices.
  - Environmental sustainability and challenges of biofuels.
