>[!tip]- Learning Goals
>Identify the concepts that shape the political geography of today’s world.
>
>Explain the processes that influence political boundaries.
# Introduction
- The contemporary world map, displaying political boundaries of about 200 countries, is the result of centuries-long processes explored in this module.
- Examines historical and present processes shaping national boundaries.
# Sovereignty and Self-Determination
- **Self-Determination:** A nation's ability to determine its statehood, allegiances, and government.
- Historical roots in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, tied to the right of culturally distinct groups to govern themselves.
- Examples include the American Revolution and the fragmentation of Russia after World War I.
- Enshrined in the [[United Nations]] charter in 1945, influencing independence movements in Africa, [[South America]], and Southeast Asia.
- The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 resulted in the creation of 15 sovereign nation-states.
## Core Areas
- Some states expanded from core areas, geographic centers of power.
- Historical power centers formed around attractive resources and geographic features, growing outward with the support of major cities.
- Core areas remain crucial in countries that diffused from a core, unlike those created to fill a political void.
- Examples include France, China, and the United States.
- Countries without a political core, like Belgium and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, face challenges to national identity.
## The Physical Environment
- Political phenomena and spatial variations often linked to terrain, soils, climate, and [[natural resources]].
- Natural protection, like mountains or coastlines, historically aided a country's survival.
- Territorial growth justified by doctrines like Manifest Destiny (U.S.) or the belief in Euro-American privilege (Russia).
# Sovereignty and Globalization
- Globalization, driven by the Internet, satellite communications, and free trade agreements, challenges nation-state sovereignty.
- Some argue that states' power diminishes as globalisation operates beyond international borders.
- Geographer John Agnew introduces the concept of effective sovereignty, where a state's power extends beyond its territory.
- Example: The U.S. exercises effective sovereignty over Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, despite being outside U.S. territory.
## Independence Movements
### Africa
- Colonialism's demise influenced by educated Africans exposed to Western political philosophy.
- Spread of political independence in Africa in the mid-20th century, overcoming hurdles like Portuguese resistance.
- Independence movements in Algeria, Zimbabwe, and [[Africa#South Africa|South Africa]] marked by conflicts and delays.
### [[South America]]
- Independence movements in [[South America]] mirrored events leading to the Revolutionary War in the United States.
- Spanish and Portuguese elites frustrated with orders from [[Europe]] led to wars for independence.
- Formation of South American countries during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
### Modern [[Europe]]
- Nationalist movements in [[Europe]], like Catalonia in Spain and Scotland in the UK, challenge state sovereignty.
- [[Devolution]] explored as a movement of power from central to regional governments within a state.
## [[Devolution]]
### Ethnocultural Forces and Ethnonationalism
- [[Devolution]] driven by forces like [[Ethnicity]], language, and religion.
- Ethnonationalism supports political interests of ethnic groups seeking independence or self-determination.
- Examples include Czechoslovakia's peaceful division and conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
### Economic Forces
- Economic factors contribute to [[devolution]], as seen in Catalonia's desire for fiscal independence from Spain.
- Examples in Sardinia, Italy, and the Republic of the Pampas in Brazil.
### Territorial Forces
- [[Devolution]] often occurs on state margins or islands, strengthened by distance from the capital.
- Examples include the United Kingdom's devolved regions, the Basques in Spain and France, and Puerto Rico's quasi-state status.
- Debate exists within separatist groups on achieving sovereignty, sometimes leading to terrorism or armed conflicts.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- What is sovereignty
>Sovereignty is the authority of a state to govern itself and make decisions within its own borders.

>[!faq]- What is globalisation
>Globalization is the increasing connectedness and interdependence of economies, cultures, and societies on a global scale.
