# Factors that Determine Manufacturing Location
1. **Transport (most important/most expensive)**
	- Raw materials[^1] (*inputs*) to factory
	- Finished **goods** (*outputs*) to **market**
	- ==Distance and weight most important factors.==
2. **Labor**
	- ==High labor costs reduce profit==
	- **May locate farther from inputs**/ market *if* **cheap labor can make up for added transport costs.**
3. **Agglomeration**
	- ==Similar businesses cluster in the same area.==
		- i.e. McDonalds & Chick-fil-A being right next to each other
	- **Businesses support each other, reduce costs**
# [[Bulk Reducing Industry]]
- *Inputs weigh more that final product.*
- **Weight is lost during the production process**
- Cost of shipping *inputs* to factory ==is greater than== the cost of shipping *outputs* to market.
- Therefore, factories are located near raw materials/ inputs.
	- i.e. [[Copper]], steel, lumber
# [[Bulk Gaining Industry]]
- *Finished product weighs more than the inputs.*
- **Weight is ==gained== during the production process.**
- Cost of shipping *outputs* to market ==is greater than== cost of shipping *inputs* to factory.
- Therefore, factory is located near the market.
	- i.e. Automobiles, beverages

# Single Market Manufacturers
- Factories that produce products for 1 or 2 customers.
	- i.e. “We build the seats for Ford cars”
- Finished seats are shipped to assembly plant.
- [[Agglomeration|Agglomerate]] near the larger plant.  
- ==This allows for **[[Just In Time Delivery|“Just In Time” delivery]]**.==
- **Parts are sent to factory right as they are needed**…*reduces need for warehouse space*
# Perishable Products
- **Must be located near market**
- ***==Short shelf life/ fast expiration==***
- Bread
- *Goes bad within the week*
- Newspaper
	- Good only for **24 hrs**.
	- “==Yesterday’s News!”==
# Keywords
- ==**[[Footloose industry]]**==
	- Produces a lightweight produce that is very valuable and/or location not much of an issue!
	- Computer chips, call centers
- **==[[Technopole]]==**
	- A [[region]] of many high tech businesses (agglomeration)
	- Silicon Valley, CA
- ==**[[Deglomeration]]**==
- The “unclumping” of similar businesses due to over crowding.
