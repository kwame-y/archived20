# [[Map Projection|Map Projections]]
- Cartographers have to deal with the problem of making maps of a spherical earth onto a flat surface → this leads to **distortions**
	-  Shape can be distorted
	- Distance between two points can increase or decrease 
	- Relative size may be altered, areas can appear much larger than they really are
	- Direction can be distorted

# Map Scale
When applied to a map, scale refers to the **relationship of the length on a map to its actual distance on Earth**. Map scale is presented in three ways: a fraction (1/24,000) or ratio (1:24,000), a written statement (“1 inch (2.54 cm) equals 1 mile (1.61 km)”), or a graphic bar scale[^1], as shown below.

- A **[[Large Scale]] map actually shows less area, but more detailed**. Imagine a **map of your neighborhood.** ^27a801
- A **[[Small Scale]] map shows more area, but less detailed**. Imagine a **map of the whole world. ^2728ab
	- Note -- it is really easy to get these two mixed up!

# Geographic Scale
- **[[City Scale|Local Scale]] - Focused in a small area, useful for gathering specific data on a specific location.**
- **[[Regional Scale]]** - **Broadens out to a larger [[Region|region]], useful for identifying trends connecting different smaller areas, similarities and differences for example.**
- **[[Global Scale]] - The most broad scale, focusing on the whole world. Useful for identifying very general trends, but may hide examples of outliers.**
