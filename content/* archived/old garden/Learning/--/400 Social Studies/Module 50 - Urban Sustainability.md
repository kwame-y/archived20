## [[Smart Growth]] Policies
- **Objective**: Combat urban and suburban [[Urban Sprawl|sprawl]] by focusing on population density and transportation.
- **Strategies**:
  - Encourage compact, walkable neighborhoods near public transportation.
  - Restrict [[Urban Sprawl|sprawl]] by protecting rural farmland and promoting denser urban development.
- **Goals**:
  - **Mixed Land Use**: Integrate residential, business, and entertainment spaces.
  - **Compact Design**: Utilize land efficiently by developing upwards.
  - **Infill Development**: Build on unused lands within existing urban areas.
  - **Walkable Neighborhoods**: Design streets for safe and convenient walking.
  - **Transportation Choices**: Support quality public transportation and infrastructure for biking and walking.
  - **Housing Variety**: Offer diverse housing options for all income levels.
  - **Environmental Preservation**: Protect natural and agricultural areas.

## [[New Urbanism]]
- **Focus**: Create dense, attractive, and diverse urban environments.
- **Principles**:
  - **Walkability**: Amenities within a 10-minute walk of homes and workplaces.
  - **Connectivity**: An interconnected street grid to facilitate walking.
  - **Mixed Use and Diversity**: Blend different types of uses and housing within neighborhoods.
  - **Diverse Housing Options**: Provide a range of housing types and prices.
  - **Quality Architecture**: Emphasize beauty, comfort, and a sense of place.
  - **Traditional Neighborhood Structure**: Design neighborhoods with a clear center and decreasing density towards edges.
  - **Increased Density**: Closer proximity of buildings and services.
  - **Smart Transportation**: Develop public transportation and pedestrian-friendly streets.
  - **[[Sustainability]]**: Focus on energy efficiency and reduced automobile dependence.
  - **Quality of Life**: Create environments that enhance living standards.

## [[Greenbelts|Greenbelt]] Development
- **Objective**: Preserve natural spaces around urban areas to limit [[Urban Sprawl|sprawl]].
- **Benefits**:
  - Beautification and promotion of healthy lifestyles.
  - Ecological health through [[Carbon Dioxide]] absorption.
  - Connection of urban dwellers to nature.
  - Support for local agriculture and tourism.

## Slow-Growth Cities
- **Approach**: Update [[zoning laws]] to manage urban expansion and mitigate [[Urban Sprawl|sprawl]].
- **Examples**: Issaquah, Washington's efforts to revamp city codes and encourage diverse housing options.

## Positive Responses to Urban Design Initiatives
- **Outcomes**:
  - Improved quality of life and local amenities.
  - Health benefits from reduced pollution and increased physical activity.
  - Economic incentives for developers to follow [[smart growth]] principles.
  - Environmental and agricultural benefits from [[Greenbelts|greenbelt]] preservation.

## Negative Responses to Urban Design Initiatives
- **Concerns**:
  - Potential decrease in property values due to increased density.
  - Reduced availability of affordable housing.
  - Restrictions on land use for property owners.
  - Disruption of existing communities by mixed-use development.
