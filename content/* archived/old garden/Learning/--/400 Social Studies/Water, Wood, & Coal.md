- In the early stages of [[Industrialisation]] many factories were positioned near sources of running/rushing [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]] and waterfalls were ideal locations
- The way [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]] was an early source of power was because it had the ability to power/spin new machinery that relied on spinning to weave products.
- Wood was another large source of energy in the early stages of [[Industrialisation]].
- Proximity to forests was critical for early steelmaking due to the charcoal which was produced from during the steel melting process which wood was burned
- The production and development of the steam engine(which ran off of COAL instead of WOOD) allowed manufacturers to move away from the older power sources of wood and [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]] and move into cities and rely off of coal and other fossil fuels which powered steam engines much greater than wood and [[Dihydrogen Oxide|water]].
- This caused factories to begin to cluster together in cities 
- Also this relocation into cities allowed factories to access benefits within labor and transportation.
- However contrary to the many benefits of coal it is very bulky, heavy, and difficult to transport which led to industries that relied heavily on coal to flee to coal field
- A prime example of this are Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (pg. 676)
- Pittsburgh Pennsylvania became the center of the world most productive steelmaking region due to its location in the center of many several coalfields
- As innovations in transportation progressed and developed(canals and railroads being examples) coal steadily became more available farther away from the mines. 
- However steelmaking required vast amounts of coal, so much indeed it was more economically beneficial for steel mills to be located near coal fields
