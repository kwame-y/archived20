## Variations in Population Data Around the World
- Different countries and regions have varying definitions of what constitutes a city, town, or metropolis based on population size.
- China and the United States have different thresholds for categorizing settlements as towns, small cities, medium-sized cities, large cities, and super cities.
- The U.S. [[Census]] Bureau defines ==urban areas, urban clusters, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), and micropolitan statistical areas differently, with specific population criteria for each.==
## Cities, Towns, and Suburbs
- ==Towns are smaller than cities but can still be self-sufficient with a [[central business district]] ([[Central Business District|CBD]]) and various land uses.==
- ==Suburbs are residential areas on the outskirts of a city==, often with their own government. Older suburbs were not self-sufficient, while modern suburbs may have more amenities.
## Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)
- ==MSAs in the U.S. consist of a central county with adjacent outlying counties that are economically and socially integrated,== as measured by commuting patterns.
- The largest MSAs in the U.S. have seen varying population changes, with some increasing and others decreasing in population.
## The World [[Urbanization]] Pattern
- ==Over half of the world's population lives in cities, with projections suggesting an increase to 68% by 2050.==
- [[Urbanization]] levels vary by region, with ==higher rates in [[Europe]], [[North America]], Latin America, and the Caribbean, **and lower rates in Africa and [[Asia]]**.==
- Urban growth is predominantly occurring in the developing world, leading to challenges such as unemployment, inadequate housing, and strained infrastructure.
## [[Megacities 1]] and [[Metacities]]
- ==[[Metacities]] have regional populations over 20 million, while [[Megacities 1]] have over 10 million.==
- The majority of the world's largest cities are in the developing world, **a shift from 50 years ago when Western cities dominated the list**
	- *Current [[World City|World Cities]]*

		- London
		- Tokyo
		- Paris
		- Hong Kong
		- Singapore
		- Los Angeles
		- Sydney
		- Berlin
	- *[[Metacities]]*
		- [[Tokyo]]
		- [[Delhi]]
		- [[Shanghai]]
		- [[Sao Paulo]]
		- [[Mexico City]]
	- *[[Megacities 1]]*
		- [[Cairo]] 
		- [[Mumbai]]
		- [[Beijing]]
		- [[Dhaka]]
		- [[Osaka–Kobe–Kyoto]]
- These classifications are based on population size, not development level or standard of living.
## [[Suburbanization]], [[Urban Sprawl|Sprawl]], and [[Decentralization]]
- **[[Suburbanization]] is the movement of people from urban core areas to the outskirts of a city.**
- ==[[Urban Sprawl]] refers to unchecked outward growth of cities,== often facilitated by **automobile dependency**.
- [[Decentralization]] involves the relocation of corporate operations to suburban areas, closer to the workforce.
## [[Edge Cities]]
- ==[[Edge Cities]] are suburban hubs of business, shopping, and entertainment, distinct from traditional downtown areas==.
- They have specific characteristics, *including significant office and retail space, and a daytime population increase due to jobs outnumbering homes*.
- [[Edge Cities]] represent a third wave of development, following the movement of homes and retail to the suburbs.
## [[Boomburbs]]
- ==[[Boomburbs]] are large suburbs with populations over 100,000 and their own governments, not core cities of metropolitan areas.==
- They have experienced **rapid population growth and are often found in the Sun Belt, with nearly half in California.**
- [[Boomburbs]] are evolving, with some developing downtown-like areas through **[[infill development]].**
## [[Exurbs]]
- **[[Exurbs]] are semi-rural areas beyond suburbs, often inhabited by affluent[^1] families and located near farmland, beaches, or mountains.**
- They offer a different lifestyle from cities and suburbs, ==with more space but further from urban amenities.==
- Technology has facilitated the development of [[exurbs]] by enabling remote work and access to goods and services, potentially leading to self-contained living systems.
