## North American Urban City Models
### **[[Burgess’ Concentric Zone Model]]**
  - Developed by E. W. Burgess in 1924.
  - Cities grow in concentric zones with five main areas:
    - [[Central Business District]] ([[Central Business District|CBD]])
    - Zone of Transition (low-quality housing, vice, crime)
    - Zone of Independent Workers' Homes (working-class stability)
    - Middle-Class Residences (suburbs)
    - Commuters' Zone ([[exurbs]], larger properties)
  - Growth pattern: inward to outward migration as people achieve upward mobility.
### **[[Hoyts’ Sector Model]]**
  - Created by Homer Hoyt in 1939.
  - City growth is influenced by transportation routes.
  - High-income residential areas develop along major transit routes.
  - Industrial sectors grow outward from the [[Central Business District|CBD]] near freight lines.
  - Middle-income housing surrounds wealthy areas; low-income areas are between manufacturing and middle-income zones.
### **[[Harris-Ullmans’ Multiple Nuclei Model]]**
  - Proposed by Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman in 1945.
  - Cities have multiple centers (nuclei) for different activities.
  - Growth is less focused on the [[Central Business District|CBD]] and more on suburban nodes.
  - Nodes develop independently based on their functions.
### **[[Galactic City Model|Galactic City Model]] **
  - Emerged in the 1960s, influenced by Harris.
  - [[Central Business District|CBD]] is surrounded by [[Urban Sprawl]], [[Edge Cities]], and industrial districts.
  - Linked by ring roads or beltways.
  - Employment shifts from [[Central Business District|CBD]] to suburban areas.
## Bid-Rent Theory
- Land cost is higher near the city center and decreases with distance.
- Different land uses have varying utility and accessibility needs.
- High-income residences and retail stores may also be found at city edges.
- In developed countries, the poor often live near the center for public transport access.
## International Urban Models
### **[[Griffin-Ford’s Latin American City Model]]**
  - [[Central Business District|CBD]] divided into traditional market and modern sectors.
  - Commercial spine with elite residential sectors.
  - Middle-class in the zone of maturity; lower-middle-class in the zone of in situ accretion.
  - [[Disamenity sector]] (barrios or favelas) for the very poor.
### **[[McGee’s Southeast Asian City Model]]**
  - Focus on old colonial port zone, not a formal [[Central Business District|CBD]].
  - Mixed land-use zone with residential and economic activities.
  - Elite residential zones and squatter areas for middle-class residents.
### **[[De Blij’s Sub-Saharan African City Model]]**
  - Cities have three CBDs: colonial, traditional, and market zones.
  - Mixed and ethnic residential neighborhoods surround the central areas.
  - Mining and manufacturing zones from colonial times.
