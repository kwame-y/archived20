# Identifying [[Public Controversy|Public Controversies]]
- People with many different perspectives and interests care and debate the matter
- It has to be located in a public space
	- Back then it would’ve been town squares or plaza’s
	- But today, they would be held in newspapers, books, magazines, websites, and TV
- When expressing their interests, values, and beliefs, people try to persuade others who may not share their interests, values, and beliefs
	- In many private controversies, we try to appeal to our audiences
		- In private matters it’s easier to tell the audience things they already agree with or believe, 
		- Because people who belong to the same club or work for the same corporation already have similar beliefs and interests.
	- Public controversies, on the other hand, affect and attract people with a broad range of interests, values, and beliefs.
		- In order to be widely persuasive, people arguing in public controversies must address many different interests.
		- People use the following argumentative moves in public controversies when they are trying to persuade others who don’t share their interests, values, or beliefs

| [[Direct Address to Specific Audience Members]]: The speaker identifies and tries to speak to a particular group of people.   | "Some people worry about divorce rates. Many people believe that we should do everything we can to keep families together. To them I say, you’re right. And the best way to keep families together is to keep them financially stable. That’s why extending unemployment benefits is the right thing to do. A family with unemployed parents is more likely to shatter under the stress of financial hardship.”                                                            |
| [[Concession]]: The speaker admits something the audience believes to be true.                                                | "Some people believe that the government should not tell us who we can love. And I agree, since it's impossible to regulate how people feel about one another. But adoption is not just about love. It’s about parenthood and families. When we have adoption laws that favor married couples, we’re not telling people that they cannot love one another. We’re telling people that we want our children to grow up in stable families where they are likely to prosper.” |
| [[Refutation]]: The speaker fairly represents an opponent’s viewpoint and then tries to explain why the opponent is mistaken. | "Environmentalists worry that hydrofracking will result in polluted water supplies. This can happen if we are not careful. But technological developments and strict regulations have all but removed the threat of water pollution due to hydrofracking."                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
