# [[Set|Sets]]
![[Set]]
By *well-defined* collection, ==we mean that there is no question as to what the elements of the [[set]] are representing==. For example, suppose I defined my [[set]] to be the [[set]] of all small apples in a barrel. This [[set]] would not be well-defined, since one might ask, “What is your criteria for what constitutes a ‘small’ apple?”  Whereas, if my [[set]] is “positive [[integers]],” there is no question as to which numbers belong to my [[set]].

- One names a [[set]] using {…} notation.  For example, the [[set]], $S$, of digits from 0-9 is written $$S=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$$
- [[Set]] $S$ is an example of a *[[finite set]]*, since the [[set]] contains a finite number of elements. An example of an *[[infinite set]]* would be the [[set]] of all positive [[integers]]. We could name this [[set]] $P$, and it could be symbolised as$$P=\{1,2,3\dots\}$$
- Last, it must be noted that a [[set]] may contain no elements at all. This [[set]] is called the *[[empty set]]*. It is symbolised as $\varnothing$. Thus, if $E$ is the [[empty set]], we can write$$E=\varnothing$$
