>The [[integumentary system]] is **commonly known as the skin.** This system *forms a protective barrier around the organs of the body*. It keeps out ==[[pathogens]] and prevents injury to internal organs==. It helps to **regulate body temperature and eliminates waste through [[sweat gland|sweat glands]]**. The integumentary system also **senses [[stimuli]]**, which allows the body to react to changing environmental conditions. As a health care worker, you should know the structure and functions of the integumentary system in order to treat disorders that may damage [[skin]] and make the body more vulnerable to injury or disease.
# Introduction to the [[Integumentary System]]
The skin is the body’s largest organ and is the first line of defense against infection. It contains several kinds of tissue, including epithelial, connective, and nerve tissue. This makes up our skin, hair, and nails. It also contains sweat and oil glands. The combination of these tissues and glands works together as the integumentary system. The main functions of the [[Integumentary System|skin]] are to:
- Protect the underlying body parts from injury and the invasion of [[pathogens]] 
- Regulate body temperature by controlling the loss of body heat 
- Eliminate wastes through perspiration
- Store energy in the form of fat and [[vitamins]]
- Sense touch, heat, cold, pain, and pressure through receptors
- Produce vitamin D

## Structure of the [[Integumentary System|Skin]]
[[Integumentary System|Skin]] is made up of three main layers:
- The **[[epidermis]]** is the outermost layer and has no [[blood vessels]]. These cells are constantly sloughed off.
- The **[[dermis]]** is just beneath the [[epidermis]] and contains many blood vessels. New cells are continually forming to replace those lost from the [[epidermis]]. These cells come from the stratum germinativum layer of the [[epidermis]].  
- Subcutaneous means “under the skin,” and the **[[subcutaneous tissue]]** layer connects the skin to muscle.
As noted above, the [[integumentary system]] also includes hair, nails, and cutaneous glands. Hair is an outgrowth of [[Proteins|protein]]; it projects from the [[epidermis]], though it grows from hair follicles deep in the [[dermis]]. Nails, which are made of a tough [[Proteins|protein]] called keratin, are produced from living skin cells in the fingers and toes. Cutaneous glands include:
- **[[Sweat glands]]**, that excrete sweat to regulate temperature
- **[[sebaceous glands]]**, oil-producing glands that keep skin and hair moist
- **[[ceruminous glands]]**, located in the ear canal that produce earwax (cerumen)
- **[[mammary glands]]**, the milk-producing glands located in the breast
## Skin Conditions
| Condition | Disorder | Symptoms | Preventative Measures/Treatment |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [[Acne]] | Blockage of pores of skin by hair, sebum, [[bacteria]] and dead skin cells | Blackheads, whiteheads, nodules and other types of pimples | Topical medications like [[benzoyl peroxide]], [[salicylic acid]] or [[retinol]]. [[Antibiotics]] control surface [[bacteria]] and oral contraception can help with breakouts associated with menstrual cycles. [[Isotretinoin]] ([[Accutane]]) is used for the most severe cases. |
| [[Alopecia]] | Patchy areas of hair loss due to an [[autoimmune disorder]] | Hair loss | No cure but some treatments may help hair re-grow more quickly, such as corticosteroids.  Other medications may promote hair growth, such as [[Minoxidil]]. |
| [[Athlete’s Foot]] ([[Athlete’s Foot\|tinea pedis]]) | Caused by a [[fungus]]. It usually involves the toes and the soles of the feet but is occasionally found on the hands | Itching, scaling, and sometimes painful lesions | For prevention, wearing shoes that do not constrict feet and allow good air circulation. Dry feet well after bathing and lightly apply powder between toes. Treating with (anti-fungal) medication may also be effective |
| [[Eczema\|Atopic Dermatitis]]/[[Eczema]] | Reddened areas on the surface of the skin | Early stage—areas on the skin may be red, swollen, and weeping purulent  fluid. Later stage—usually reddened, scaly, itchy areas on the skin. | Avoiding allergens. Topical applications and medication may be helpful as a treatment |
| [[Boils]] | Skin abscess caused when  bacteria enters the hair follicles or [[sebaceous glands]] | Pain, redness, and swelling | To prevent spreading of infection, it is important to avoid irritating or squeezing the lesion. Treatment may include antibiotics and local moist heat. Incision and drainage may be necessary |
