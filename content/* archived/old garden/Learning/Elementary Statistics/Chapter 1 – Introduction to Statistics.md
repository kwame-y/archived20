# 1.1 - An Overview of Statistics
>[!question] What is data?
>Data consists of information coming from observations, counts measurements, or responses.
> - “7 in 10 Americans believe the arts unify their communities, and 2 in 5 Americans have changed an opinion or perception based on an arts experience.”
> - ”Notably, 21% of 8 –11 year-olds have a social media profile.”

>[!question] What is statistics?
>Statistics is the science of collecting organising, analysing, and interpreting data to make decisions

---
## Data Sets
- A **population** is the collection of *all* outcomes, responses, measurements, or counts that are of interest.
- A **sample** is a part of the **population**

>In a recent survey, 834 employees in the United States were asked if they thought there jobs were highly stressful. Of the 834 respondents, 517 said yes. Identify the population and the sample. Describe the sample data set.

- The population in this case is all employees in the US, but the sample is the 834 that were asked “if they thought there jobs were highly stressful.”
- The data set is made up of 517 yes’s and 317 no’s.
## Parameter and Statistic
- A **parameter** is a numerical description of a characteristic of a population
	- *Average age of all people in the US*
	- *Average amount of cars produced in Venezuela*
- A **statistic** is a numerical description of a sample characteristic
	- *Average age of all people from a sample from 10 states*
	- *Average amount of cars produced in a sample of 3 Venezuelan cities*

>In the United States, a survey of about 9400 individuals aged 15 and over found that such individuals spent an average of 5.19 hours per day engaged in leisure and sports activities.
- This is a sample statistic because its based on a small subset of the population

>The freshman class at a university has an average SAT math score of 514.
- This is a population parameter because its based on the entire freshman class of a university

>In a random check of several hundred retail stores, the Food and Drug Administration found that 34% of the stores were not storing fish at the proper temperature.
- This is a sample statistic because its based on a subset of all retail stores

## Branches of Statistics
- There are two main branches of statistics:
	- Descriptive Statistics, which involes the organisation, summarisation, and display of data
	- Inferential Statistics, which involves using sample data to draw conclusions about a population
>A study of 1502 U.S. adults found that 18% of adults from households earning less than $30,000 annually do not use the Internet, as shown in the figure.
- The population is all US adults, and the sample is made up of those who were surveyed. 
- The bar graph & the statement of “18% of adults from households earning less than $30,000 annually do not use the Internet,” show the descriptive branch of statistics.
- Using inferential statistics, you can conclude that those with a lower household income are less likely to use the internet.
>A study of 1000 U.S. 401(k) retirement plan participants found that the percentage who do not know how many years their retirement savings might last is 32%.
- The population in this case are U.S. 401(k) participants, with the sample being those surveryed.
- The statement “retirement plan participants found that the percentage who do not know how many years their retirement savings might last is 32%” demonstrates the descriptive branch of statistics.
- Based on this study, we can infer that a good amount of retirees do not know how long their savings will last them, aka, the amount of money a person needs for retirement is difficult to calculate

# 1.2 - Data Classification
## Types of Data
- There are two main types of data:
	- Quantitative, which are numerical measurements
	- Qualitative, nonnumerical entries

| Sport      | Head Injuries Treated |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Basketball | 131,930               |
| Baseball   | 83,522                |
| Football   | 220,258               |
| Gymnastics | 33,265                |
| Hockey     | 41,450                |
| Soccer     | 98,710                |
| Softball   | 41,216                |
| Swimming   | 44,815                |
| Volleyball | 13,848                |
- In this table the types of sports are Qualitative and the head injuries are Quantitative
## Levels of Measurement
- **Nominal**
	- Qualitative only
	- Categorised by using names, labels, or qualities
	- No mathematical computations can be made
- **Ordinal**
	- Can be either quantitative or qualitative
	- Data can be arranged in order or ranked
	- Differences between data entries is not meaningful
- **Interval**
	- Quantitative data
	- Data can be ordered
	- Differences between data entries is meaningful
	- Zero represents a position on a scale (it does not simple imply “none”)
- **Ratio**
	- Similar to interval
	- Zero implies “none”
	- A ratio of two values can be formed
	- One data value can be expressed as a multiple of another

# 1.3 - Data Collection and Experimental Design

## Designing a Statistical Study
1. Identify the variable(s) of interest (the focus) and the population of the study.
2. Develop a detailed plan for collecting data. If you use a sample, make sure the sample is representative of the population.
3. Collect the data.
4. Describe the data using descriptive statistics techniques.
5. Interpret the data and make decisions about the population using inferential statistics.
6. Identify any possible errors.
## Data Collection
- **Observational Study**
	- A researcher observes and measures characteristics of interest of part of a population
	- Ex. *Researchers measured the amount of time people spent doing different activites (work, childcare, socialising)*
- **Experiment**
	- A **treatment** is applied to part of a population, called a **treatment group**, and responses are observed
	- Another part of the population may be used as a **control group**, in which no treatment is applied. (The subjects in both groups are called **experimental units**.)
	- In many cases, subjects in the control group a given a **[[placebo]]**, a fake treatment meant to look like the real one
	- Ex. *An experiment was performed in which overweight subjects were given the artificial sweetener sucralose to drink while a control group drank water. After performing a glucose test, researchers concluded that “sucralose affects the glycemic and insulin responses” in overweight people who do not normally consume artificial sweeteners*
- **Simulation**
	- Uses a mathematical / physical model to reproduce the conditions of a situation / process
		- Often involves the use of computers
	- Allows you to study situations that are impractical or dangerous to recreate irl
	- Ex. *Automobile manufacturers use simulations with dummies to study the effects of crashes on humans*
- **Survey**
	- An investigation of one or more characteristics of a population
		- Surveys are carried out on *people* by asking them questions through interview, phone, or mail
	- When designing a survey, it is important to word the questions so that they do not lead to biased results, which are not representative of a population.
	- In designing the survey, it would be acceptable to make a list of reasons and ask each individual in the sample to select their first choice.
	- Ex. *A survey is conducted on a sample of physicians to determine whether the primary reason for their career choice is financial stability*
## Experimental Design
Three key elements of a well-designed experiment are *control*, *randomisation*, and *replication*
- **Confounding Variables**
	- The **[[placebo|placebo effect]]** occurs when a subject reacts favourably to a **placebo** when in fact the subject have been given a fake treatment
	- To help control or minimise the placebo effect, a technique called **blinding** can be used
- **[[Blinding]]**
	- **Blinding** is a technique in which the subjects do not know whether they are receiving a treatment or a placebo
		- In a **double-blind** experiment neither the subject nor the experimenter knows if the subject is receiving a treatment or a placebo.

>[!info] Randomisation
>A process of randomly assigning subjects to different treatment groups. In a **completely randomised design**, subjects are assigned to different treatment groups through random selection
>
- **Randomised Block Design**
	- **Randomised Block Design** is when you divide subjects with similar characteristics into blocks, and then within each block, randomly assign subjects to treatment groups
	- Ex. *An experimenter testing the effects of a new weight loss drink may first divide the subjects into age categories. Then within each age group, randomly assign subjects to either the treatment group or control group.*
## Sampling Techniques
- A **census** is a count / measure of an *entire* population
- A **sampling** is a count / measure of *part* of a population and is more commonly used in statistical studies
- Occasionally, a **sampling error** may occur.A sampling error is the difference between the results of a sample and those of the population
- **Random Sample**
	- Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected
- **Simple Random Sample**
	- Every possible sample of the same size has the same chance of being selected
	- Random numbers are generated by a software program
	- These numbers are assigned to each member of the population
	- Members of the population that correspond to these numbers become members of the sample
- **Stratified Sample**
	- Divide a population into groups (strata) and select a random sample from each group
		- To collect a stratified sample of the number of people who live in West Ridge County households, you could divide the households into socioeconomic levels and then randomly select households from each level
- **Cluster Sample**
	- Divide the population into groups (clusters) and select all of the members in one or more, but not all, of the clusters
	- In the West Ridge County example you could divide the households into clusters according to zip codes, then select all the households in one or more, but not all, zip codes
- **Systematic Sample**
	- Choose a starting value at random. Then choose every $k^{th}$ member of the population
	- In the West Ridge County example you could assign a different number to each household, randomly choose a starting number, then select every 100th  household
- **Convenience Sample**
	- Choose only members of the population that are easy to get
	- Often leads to biased studies (don’t do this)
