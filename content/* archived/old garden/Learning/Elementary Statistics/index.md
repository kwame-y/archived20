Statistics is a field of math I never really enjoyed (from my basic experience), It just seemed so convoluted(?) to look at a set of data and try to do all these things to it to explain a phenomenon. 
I think now I get its purpose, especially as it will be a daily occurrence when working in the medical field, hopefully this course gives me a better view on statistics, and maybe I’ll enjoy using it, we shall see…
