# Basic Sentence Template
**[Subject] *li* [Object] *na* [Verb-Chain].**

- **li** → topic marker (optional for subject)
- **na** → object marker
- **Verb-Chain** → root + suffixes for tense/aspect/politeness/etc.

>[!quote] Example:  
>**oremi li nemi na miya-ta-mi.**
_The person respectfully saw the cat._


>[!info] Plurality
Plural is **not required** unless needed for meaning. (Context usually suffices)
Add **-no** to nouns to mark plural.

[^2]: In a sentence that has multiple subjects, -ka is used identify who exactly is doing what
