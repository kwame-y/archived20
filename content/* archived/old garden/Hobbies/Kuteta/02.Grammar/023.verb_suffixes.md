# Usage & Stacking Order
Verb suffixes are applied **in layers**, following a typical order:
**[NEG-] root + [Aspect] + [Tense] + [Mood] + [Politeness]**
## Examples:

|Verb Root|Suffixes|Full Verb|Meaning|
|---|---|---|---|
|kulo (to speak)|-ta|kulo-ta|spoke|
|dusel (to sing)|-ri -no -mi|dusel-ri-no-mi|will be singing (respectfully)|
|nami (to eat)|a- -ta -mi|a-nami-ta-mi|did not eat (politely)|
|miya (to see)|-mu|miya-mu|has seen|
|kulo (to speak)|-no -za|kulo-no-za|will speak (rude/disrespectful)|

# Negation

- The **prefix** _a-_ attaches directly to the verb root.
- The **particle** _ne_ may be used before the verb for emphasis or clarity:
    > _remi li ne kulo-no_ → “The person will not speak.”
- Using both _ne_ and _a-_ together is possible but optional:[^1]
    > _remi li ne a-kulo-no-mi_ → Fully negated, polite, future action.
