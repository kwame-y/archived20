# Script Forms
## **Block-Style Script**
- Each syllable is written as a **glyph block**.
- Follows the (C)(G)V(C/N) structure:
	- **Vowel** sits **above** the consonant[^1]
	- **Glide** appears **to the left** of the consonant 
	- **Nasal coda** appears **to the right** of the consonant

**Layout per syllable block:**
```
   [V]
 [G]C[N]
```

- All blocks are constructed using the base glyphs from the alphabet.
- Glides and codas may appear as **miniature or stylised forms** (diacritics) for compactness.
## **Linear Alphabetic Script**
- Each phoneme is written in sequence from **left to right**, similar to the Latin alphabet.
- No special formatting required.
- Useful for typing, dictionaries, and learning.
**Example:**
- Block form: ku → [k+u block], te → [t+e block], ta → [t+a block]
- Linear form: kuteta → k - u - t - e - t - a

# Affixes
Kuteta uses **agglutinative affixes**, especially suffixes. These are handled as **separate syllable blocks** in writing and may be linked to a root through a ‘~’ symbol.
### Rules:
- **Each affix** (e.g., -ta, -mi, -no) is written as its own block.
- No merging or stacking within root blocks.
**Example:**
- dusel-ta-mi → du • sel • ta • mi (4 blocks)
- a-nami → a • na • mi (3 blocks)
## Punctuation
- Phrase Stop
	- Symbol: | with a dot at the bottom
	- Use: End of sentence or thought
- Minor Pause
	- Symbol: ⌒
	- Use: Break between clauses or list items
- Question Marker
	- Symbol: ‿ or ::
	- Use: Replaces phrase stop at end of a question[^2]
- Exclamation / Emphasis
	- Symbol: ||
	- Use: Emphasise a phrase, not nece
- Quotation Marks
	- Symbol: < quote >
	- Use: Indicates speech or cited words
- Paragraph / Section Break
	- Symbol: Large ◎
	- Use: New thought, dialogue, or scene

My notes in my journal as I was coming up with this system:
![[kuteta_alphabet.pdf]]



[^1]: In the case of CVC, the second consonant is placed on top of the vowel

[^2]: Only use if -ke is not enough

[^3]: This form of script also opens the path for different ways of writing, whether that be up & down, left to write, or arranging letters in a large circle (I might actually modify it to make circular form possible/more easier)

[^4]: Will be added upon as I develop the .svg files
