What is up loyal reader of this language, today I got a lot of work done, I mainly worked on developing a viable [[021.sentence_structure|sentence structure]], honestly I like how it’s shaping up, and I’ve left a lot of things ambiguous so I can develop them further. 

I’ve made the [[011.phonemes]] note more detailed and added 2 more consonants & vowels to flesh out Kuteta more, I also came up with a [[041.script]] with the help of a friend to go with each phoneme (I’ll be making an actual font for this). Now because these glyphs are kinda complex, i’m gonna make a more romanised, yet unique script corresponding to each glyph, so by the end we’ll have: Glyphs representing the alphabet, Glyphs representing syllables, & a script for the alphabet. I think the syllabic glyphs will just be simplified combinations of the existing ones so far.

On that, I mean that i’m gonna take the english alphabet, and kinda warp it so it looks legible to an english reader, but still have some uniqueness without just being a plain romanisation
