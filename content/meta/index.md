## why?

> my relationship with my website has felt strained lately. i'm embarrassed to admit that i'm having trouble dealing with the amount of attention it's gotten. i love working on my site and i don't plan to stop, but i still find myself craving another outlet. something that's lower pressure, with no expectations of style. less public performance and more personal utility. last week, i started writing my thoughts into [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and generating a site from them with [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), and i'm pretty happy with the result. it feels good to make something from just my words.
