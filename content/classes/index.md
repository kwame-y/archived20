Notes from formal coursework.

These are written primarily to understand material well enough to move on, not to be comprehensive or final. Some notes are actively revised; others are kept as records of how I learned something at the time.

Subjects are grouped by discipline rather than chronology.

Statuses here usually range from **fragment** to **stable**, depending on where I am in the course.
