I bought an accordion in March of 2020, about a week before my workplace shut down. having a new instrument to learn helped me cope with everything going on that year. I played a lot but never got comfortable playing with both hands simultaneously. I mostly goofed around and used the bass keys to play and sing whatever I could find on [ultimate-guitar.com](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/)

I haven't played much recently, but I'd like to get back into it.
