**writing about making games that resonates with me:**
- [How To Make Good Small Games](https://farawaytimes.blogspot.com/2023/02/how-to-make-good-small-games.html) by Far Away Times
	- "By adjusting your perspective, you can start making games you’re happy with _right now_. Find the tool that feels right to you. Spend an evening fiddling with it. Make something happen on the screen that you like, that sparks a tiny fire in your chest. Then think about what a small game built around that spark might look like."
- ["Can I make games alone if I don't like players?"](https://josh04.itch.io/can-i-make-games-alone-if-i-dont-like-players) by josh
	- "I make my games like I built sandcastles as a child."
- [on solo dev](http://harmonyzone.org/blog/posts/solodev/) by harmonyzone
	- "i was a solo dev for a while and what i mean by that is this: that i was making games where i didn't have to talk to anyone."
