## play on [itch.io](https://ribozone.itch.io/eukaryote-story) or [my site](https://ribo.zone/eukaryote-story)

- my first game!
- released: july 28, 2024
- engine: [[bitsy]]

> In July, I made my first video game. I had a free weekend, so I started messing around in [bitsy](https://bitsy.org/), a tiny and beginner-friendly game engine. I recommend it! From Saturday afternoon to Sunday morning (with a healthy amount of sleep in the middle), I worked out some of the ideas that rattle around in my head all the time. The result is a 5-7 minute adventure game called Eukaryote Story; you can play it on [my site](https://ribo.zone/eukaryote-story/) or [itch.io](https://ribozone.itch.io/eukaryote-story). I would love for you to check it out and let me know what you think. I would also love to make more games! There's a [bitsy jam](https://itch.io/jam/bitsy-83-temporary) happening _right now_, so I'm brainstorming... We'll see.
