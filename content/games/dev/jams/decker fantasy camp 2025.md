## devlog

#### july 1<sup>st</sup>

- i joined the [decker visual novel jam](https://itch.io/jam/decker-vn-jam) in may/june, but bailed because i didn't come up with a story idea
	- i still do want to make a VN in decker... hmmmmmmm...
	- maybe the "novel" part intimidates me. would it be easier to get started if i call it a poem or a zine?
- **BE BOLD!** IT'S [[games/dev/jams/index|JAM]] TIME!

#### july 2<sup>nd</sup>

- searching my mind for ideas, still not finding any stories
-  starting from scratch is too hard, so what if i just expand on something i've made in the past? what's an idea that still nags at me?
	- i think about [ribo.zone/weirdweb/ritual/](https://ribo.zone/weirdweb/ritual/) a lot
	- omg [pink decker jam](https://itch.io/jam/pink-decker-jam) is still going
	- whoa... that's it -- pink cell culture point & click
- deadline is now **July 19th 2025 at 9:41 AM EST** if i want to submit to both jams

#### july 3<sup>rd</sup>

- took some photos in lab today
	- no plan, just the obvious ones: biohazard labels, hood, microscope, cells
	- put a few into decker and they look good in 1-bit pink :)
- not sure if i want to go in a more point & clicky or text-centric direction
	- at minimum, i could just give each written step from /weirdweb/ritual/ a corresponding photo
	- i want to do more, but... small scope -> finished game
- did the css for the itch page 

#### july 12 <sup>th</sup>

- i'm so used to working within the limits of html/css that having a canvas where i can put anything anywhere feels kind of overwhelming... aaaaeee
- thinking about multimedia, thinking about tone, thinking about real data vs the illusion of data
- added a table from wikipedia
	- highlight table text -> ctrl+c -> create new google sheet -> ctrl+v -> download as .csv -> open .csv in notepad++ -> ctrl+a -> ctrl+c -> open widget menu in decker -> new grid -> check "Edit as CSV" -> ctrl+v -> yay
- really pleased with the first two cards, but the third is kicking my ass for some reason
	- text is starting to diverge from original webpage (good) but idk exactly what i want to say (frustrating)
	- the image i wanted to use looks awkward every way i've tried to arrange it with text (extra frustrating)
- i still have like a week to make this! it will be ok

#### july 17<sup>th</sup>

- oh shit where did the week go?
	- mostly work
	- dinner & live music one night w/ ben's ma
	- melonland got guilds! [i made one](https://forum.melonland.net/index.php?action=mguild;sa=view;gid=7)! so spent a bunch of my free computer time this week working on that instead of working on this, oops
		- "you got nerd sniped" - ben
- i still think i might be able to make the pink decker deadline (1 day 11 hours from now, at time of writing). i may not have been actively working on it but the ideas have been rotating in my mind. i think i know how i want to rework the part i was stuck on over the weekend

#### july 18<sup>th</sup>

- i took some more photos in lab
	- didn't get every step of cell culture because i didn't want to be slow and stress my cells out
- eeeek friday night crumch
- spent a while messing with the position of text instead of writing again...
- asked ben for advice on text positioning and he told me that is isn't the layout, it's the text (true)
	- rewrote it and made a card that felt good and right, then scrapped all original plans of what should come after and focused on that feeling
		- it is done :)
- all that's left is to add links to the credits section
	- wait can i not have text be a link *and*  be monospace? it's one or the other? noooo
		- well. ok. 'tis what 'tis
- i submitted with about 9 hours left yaaaay wooohooooo
- still past my bedtime. i sleep

#### july 21<sup>st</sup>

- almost jumped out of my chair when i noticed pizzapranks added cell culture to [this collection](https://itch.io/c/4565/to-play) on itch.io
	- "If your game is on this list I would certainly recommend [submitting](http://indiepocalypse.com/submit) your game to Indiepocalypse!"
	- i was literally listening to indiepocalypse radio at that moment
	- unbelievably wild
		- i did it
