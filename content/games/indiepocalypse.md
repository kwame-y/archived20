- [PIZZA PRANKS -- home of indiepocalypse](https://pizzapranks.com/)

> _Indiepocalypse_ is a monthly anthology of video and/or physical games, simple as that! Every month I (which is to say Andrew, should you see the name around) curate a collection of 10 games, bundle them together, and you, (hopefully) buy the bundle and get all these games to play for yourself. It costs 15 USD. Sometimes it goes on sale for ~10.
>
> It’s the reliable anthology model that provides a low-risk opportunity for newer artists and artists whose work can struggle to find an audience when thrown into the mainstream bucket with more traditionally commercial games. It’s also a great home for shorter and more experimental works. Basically any healthy artform some have something like anthologies!
> 
> But it’s not just “exposure”, each developer is also paid when they are selected and receive royalties.
