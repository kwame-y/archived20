This section contains research-related thinking: background reading, synthesis notes, and early-stage proposals.

Most work here is exploratory.  

Some notes aim to clarify questions rather than answer them. Others document directions I may or may not pursue further.

If something is marked **archived**, it reflects a completed line of thought, not a discarded one.
