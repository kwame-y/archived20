hello! i’m kwame.

this is **`* archived`**, a personal digital garden: a (hopefully) living archive of notes from my classes, research interests, unfinished ideas, creative projects, and things i don’t want to forget too quickly.

---

## what lives here?

you’ll find notes spanning a few overlapping threads:

- **school & coursework**  
  biology, chemistry, math, and whatever else i’m currently learning --- organized loosely & revised occasionally

- **research & inquiry**  
  ideas, literature notes, proposals, and background reading, especially around biology, neuroscience, and biomedical engineering.

- **creative work**  
  music inspiration, compositional sketches, ideas, aesthetics, and references.

- **personal thinking**  
  thoughts, frameworks, questions, and connections i’m still working through.

---

## how to read this site?

there is no required order.

you can:
- follow links until something catches,
- browse by tags,
- or treat each page as a standalone note.

some notes are **seedlings**, some are **evergreen**, some are quietly decaying. i'll try to mark them honestly.

## a note on accuracy & intent

most of what’s here is written to help *me* understand things better.  
which means:
- errors are possible,
- context may be missing,
- revisions always happen.

if something looks useful, please treat it as a starting point
